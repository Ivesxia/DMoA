        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of EtOH Pancreatitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of epigastric pain, elevated lipase level (668), and a history of alcohol use, despite it being described as minimal. The abdominal ultrasound did not show gallstones or biliary duct dilation, further supporting the diagnosis of pancreatitis rather than cholecystitis or other abdominal pathologies."
