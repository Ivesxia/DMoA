        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse periumbilical abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with nausea and vomiting for four days. A CT scan revealed an enlarged and edematous pancreas with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with pancreatitis. Other potential causes of abdominal pain, like biliary colic, were ruled out as the patient has never experienced it and her gallbladder was intact without signs of stones or inflammation."
