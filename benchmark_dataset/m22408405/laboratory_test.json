            "findings": "A 7 mm segment V liver hypodensity with suggestion of peripheral enhancement may be a hemangioma, but is too small to accurately characterize. Otherwise, the liver is unremarkable. The spleen is normal. Bilateral adrenals, left kidney, and pancreas are all normal. A subcentimeter hypodensity in the right kidney is too small to accurately characterize, but the kidney is otherwise normal. Extending from the cecum in a retrocecal area is a blind-ending fluid filled tubular structure with a hyperemic wall measuring 1 cm in maximal diameter. This is worrisome for retrocecal appendicitis. No fluid collection or free air is identified. Bladder, prostate and rectum are unremarkable. Scrotal wall thickening is again demonstrated. There are no aggressive bony lesions.",
