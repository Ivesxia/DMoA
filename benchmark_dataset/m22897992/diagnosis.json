        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with approximately 48 hours of abdominal pain that migrated from the epigastric region to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and anorexia. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ, guarding, and a positive Rovsing sign, which are consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, which supported the diagnosis, despite no pathological findings in the pelvis."
