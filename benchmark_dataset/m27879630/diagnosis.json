    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with one day of worsening abdominal pain that started in the upper abdomen and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Accompanying symptoms included nausea and vomiting, with a history of no prior abdominal surgeries. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the RLQ and a soft abdomen without rebound tenderness, which supported the diagnosis. No signs indicative of fever or significant gastrointestinal bleeding were noted. The background of previous benign findings during a colonoscopy also suggested that acute appendicitis was the primary concern."
