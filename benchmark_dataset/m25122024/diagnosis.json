        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain lasting three days, which was associated with poor oral intake. Ultrasound findings indicated a distended gallbladder with wall thickening and edema but no stones, which supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Additional findings included mild intrahepatic biliary dilation and evidence of pneumobilia, contributing to the clinical picture."
