        "final_diagnosis": "appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset right-sided abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting, and a history of a prior ruptured appendix. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness, particularly on the right side, and signs of guarding. Radiographic findings indicated multiple dilated loops of small bowel consistent with early or partial small-bowel obstruction, but no evidence of free air, leaning towards appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis."
