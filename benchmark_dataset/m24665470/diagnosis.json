        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain localized in the right lower quadrant, which worsened over the previous days. Despite the appendix being described as top-normal size to minimally dilated on imaging, it was fluid-filled and did not fill with oral contrast. This finding, along with the patient's symptoms of nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, led to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
