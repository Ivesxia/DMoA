        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset central abdominal pain, most pronounced in the right lower quadrant, nausea, and bloating. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dilated appendix with mural enhancement and surrounding fatty stranding, measuring up to 10 mm, consistent with acute appendicitis. There were no other significant findings in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest alternative diagnostics."
