        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with persistent abdominal pain following an ERCP procedure, with notable lab findings of slightly elevated lipase, and developed a fever. Imaging studies did not reveal acute processes. The differential was considered based on the patient's history of pancreatic cysts, and the findings from the ED evaluations."
