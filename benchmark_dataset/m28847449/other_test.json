These findings are most consistent with perforated appendicitis with an abscess. Small lymph nodes are noted within the right lower quadrant. Adjacent bowel loops including the proximal cecum, terminal ileum and rectum are thickened likely due to inflammation. There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.",
