            "findings": "Lung bases are clear. Liver demonstrates minimal signal loss on out of phase imaging consistent with mild fatty deposition in the liver. An 8 x 7 mm lesion within the left lobe of the liver is hyperintense to hepatic parenchyma on T2 weighted imaging and demonstrates early peripheral enhancement on the arterial phase with delayed filling on postcontrast imaging consistent with a hemangioma. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation, and the portal vein is patent. Multiple gallstones are present without evidence of cholecystitis. No stones are present in the common bile duct. The pancreas is of normal signal intensity without any ductal dilatation, abnormal enhancement, or other evidence of disease. Multiple cystic structures are seen throughout the pancreas, all less than 5 mm, most likely side branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. The spleen is unremarkable. There are multiple lesions in the kidneys that are hyperintense on T2 weighted imaging, which do not demonstrate appreciable enhancement and are most consistent with simple cysts. The largest measures 3.6 x 2.8 cm in the lower pole of the right kidney. Additionally, there is a 5 mm cystic lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney that is hypointense to renal parenchyma on T2 weighted imaging and hyperintense on T1 weighted imaging, most consistent with a small hemorrhagic cyst. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The stomach and visualized small and large bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy within the abdomen. Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. The aorta is of normal caliber. There is no abnormal bone marrow signal.",
