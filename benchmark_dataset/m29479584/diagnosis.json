        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with gradually worsening abdominal pain, which progressed to severe periumbilical pain, indicative of acute abdominal pathology. CT imaging revealed an intermediate attenuating fluid collection in the pre-sacral area, compatible with an abscess, and indicated a recent sigmoid colectomy. The surgical history, clinical presentation, and imaging findings collectively support the diagnosis of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis."
