        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by ultrasound findings showing a distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid, minimal gallbladder wall edema, and no cholelithiasis. Cardiology evaluated the patient's pain and determined it was not cardiac in origin."
