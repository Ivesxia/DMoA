        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of periumbilical pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), fever, and anorexia. CT findings revealed an appendicolith and a fluid-filled appendix measuring 11 mm with significant stranding in the RLQ, consistent with acute appendicitis."
