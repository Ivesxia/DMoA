The adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys are normal with a subcentimeter hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney likely representing a cyst. The appendix is dilated to 1 cm, fluid filled with hyperemic mildly thickened wall, and mild periappendiceal fat stranding. No evidence of drainable fluid collection or perforation. Scattered prominent mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant likely reactive.
