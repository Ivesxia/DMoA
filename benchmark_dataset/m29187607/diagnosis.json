        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute on chronic appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of acute right lower quadrant pain, the CT findings of a distended appendix with associated soft tissue strain, and the presence of an appendicolith. No other significant abdominal pathology was found on imaging, and there were no signs of abscess formation."
