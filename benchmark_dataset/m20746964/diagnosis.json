        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening lower abdominal pain, positive rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and findings on CT imaging that showed an enlarged, inflamed appendix with surrounding phlegmonous changes and a small abscess. The absence of other significant findings in the abdomen and pelvis supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
