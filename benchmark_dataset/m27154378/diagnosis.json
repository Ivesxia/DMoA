        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal discomfort, particularly in the right lower quadrant, and a history of uncomplicated diverticulitis. The evaluation included a past history of similar complaints and imaging findings consistent with diverticular disease. The decision for open appendectomy suggests a primary concern for appendicitis, with diverticular disease considered due to the patient's history."
