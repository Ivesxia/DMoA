        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis was supported by the CT scan findings showing wall thickening and significant fatty stranding of the distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon, suggesting inflammation consistent with colitis. Additionally, the presence of air foci adjacent to the sigmoid colon is more likely to be in diverticula rather than indicating microperforation."
