        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cholecystitis was supported by the patient's history of biliary colic, exacerbation of right upper quadrant pain following fatty meals, and ultrasound findings of multiple gallstones, sludge, gallbladder wall thickening, and edema. The absence of other symptoms such as fever or icterus, along with a well-appearing status, helped confirm the diagnosis."
