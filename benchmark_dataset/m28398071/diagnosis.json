        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 12-hour history of worsening epigastric abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ and positive obturator sign. CT abdomen and pelvis indicated an enlarged appendix with fluid and potential obstructing appendicolith, along with surrounding fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
