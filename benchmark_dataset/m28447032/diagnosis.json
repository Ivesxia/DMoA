        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of pancreatitis was suggested by the patient's presentation of epigastric abdominal pain, which was sharp and burning and had a band-like quality that radiated to the back. Past episodes of similar pain were triggered by the ingestion of rich, fatty foods. Laboratory findings showed elevated lipase levels (Lip 1059), which is indicative of pancreatitis. Imaging studies (RUQUS) ruled out acute cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, further supporting the diagnosis."
