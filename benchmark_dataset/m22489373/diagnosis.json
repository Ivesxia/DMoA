        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that originated in the epigastric area and migrated throughout the abdomen, consistent with appendicitis. The pain was exacerbated when lying on the right side and leaning over. Supporting symptoms included subjective fevers, anorexia, and lethargy, distinct from her history of irritable bowel syndrome. No bowel habit changes were noted. The physical examination indicated tenderness throughout the abdomen, which supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
