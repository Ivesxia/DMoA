    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a woman with a history of chronic abdominal pain, presented with worsened midepigastric pain after a recent hysterectomy for uterine cancer. The pain was exacerbated by food intake, particularly dairy products. MRCP findings showed marked dilation of the extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple small cystic lesions of the pancreatic body and tail, without evidence of acute inflammation or solid pancreatic mass. These features, coupled with her clinical history and presentation, supported the diagnosis of acute on chronic pancreatitis."
