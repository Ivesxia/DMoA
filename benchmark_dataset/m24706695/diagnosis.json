        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pancreatitis is supported by the significant elevation of lipase levels (initial lipase 728, trending to 2902) along with the patient's presentation of epigastric pain that has radiated and is associated with vomiting. Additionally, ultrasound findings indicate decreased echogenicity of the pancreas suggestive of edema, and there were no focal lesions identified in the pancreas."
