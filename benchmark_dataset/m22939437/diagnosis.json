        "final_diagnosis": "Right sided diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of left lower quadrant pain, severe cramping, chills, and imaging showing extensive wall thickening in the cecum and proximal-to-mid ascending colon indicates diverticulitis. The CT findings of fat stranding and thickening corroborate this diagnosis, while the presence of a large inguinal hernia was noted but not identified as the primary issue."
