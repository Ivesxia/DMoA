There is interval placement of a right anterolateral approach percutaneous pigtail drain at the site of previously seen fluid, which is reduced in volume. There is a multi-lobulated, rim-enhancing fluid collection spanning the right hemipelvis with various measurements. Small volume abdominopelvic ascites is improved. No evidence of significant lesions, hydronephrosis, or lymphadenopathy.",
