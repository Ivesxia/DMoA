            "findings": "Lower thorax: Limited evaluation of the lung bases are clear. No pleural effusion. Liver: Homogeneous in signal intensity without suspicious mass. No imaging features suggestive of advanced cirrhosis. No ascites. Biliary: No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Gallbladder not visualized. Pancreas: Homogeneous in signal intensity without suspicious mass. No pancreatic duct dilatation or peripancreatic fat stranding. Spleen: Normal in size without suspicious mass. Adrenal Glands: Bilateral adrenal glands are symmetric in size without discrete nodule. Kidneys: Bilateral kidneys are homogeneous in signal intensity without suspicious mass. No hydronephrosis or perinephric fat stranding. Gastrointestinal Tract: Wall edema and fat stranding surrounding the distal ileum, terminal ileum, and inferomedial aspect of the cecal base with associated phlegmonous changes and thickening of the right lateroconal fascia. Total extent of phlegmonous change measures approximately 4.5 x 4 cm at the level of the cecal base. A punctate 0.6 cm T2 and T1 hypointense lesion consistent with an appendicolith is seen. The findings are indicative of potential ruptured appendicitis.",
