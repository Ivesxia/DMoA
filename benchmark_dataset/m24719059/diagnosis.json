        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by ultrasound findings of moderately distended gallbladder with layering echogenic material (consistent with sludge), without gallstones, and the presence of mild intrahepatic ductal dilation. The absence of other significant findings such as choledocholithiasis and a negative sonographic Murphy's sign also contributed to this diagnosis."
