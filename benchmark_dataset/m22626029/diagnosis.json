        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a two-day history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, described as sharp and worsening over time, accompanied by nausea and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant with mild rebound tenderness. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a dilated appendix up to 13 mm with surrounding stranding and secondary inflammation of the terminal ileum, which supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
