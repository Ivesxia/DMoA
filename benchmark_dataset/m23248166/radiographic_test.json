The portal vein is patent. No gallstones are evident within the gallbladder. No evidence for choledocholithiasis. Noted pancreas divisum. There is slight irregularity of the duct noted within the tail of the pancreas, likely sequelae from prior episode; however, no pancreatic ductal dilatation.

No evidence for other conditions on today's study. There are no retroperitoneal masses or adenopathy. No abnormally dilated small or large bowel loop in the visualized upper abdomen. No free fluid.
