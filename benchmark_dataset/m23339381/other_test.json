Subtle arterial hyperenhancement of the hepatic parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder fossa. The liver is otherwise homogeneous in signal intensity without suspicious mass. Biliary: No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Common bile duct is normal in caliber which smoothly tapers at the ampulla. No periampullary mass. No choledocholithiasis. The gallbladder is notable for cholelithiasis. Mild gallbladder distention and gallbladder wall edema noted. Pancreas: 0.3 cm T2 hyperintense lesion is seen within the pancreatic body for which no additional follow-up is warranted.",
