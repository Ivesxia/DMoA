    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was supported by the patient's history of severe epigastric pain, recurrent mild epigastric pain over the past year, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea after fatty meals, elevated lipase levels (291), and the patient's presentation after taking medication on an empty stomach. The ultrasound findings showed no focal lesions in the liver or significant gallbladder pathology, pointing further towards pancreatic involvement."
