    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's acute onset of constant right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, along with focal tenderness over a noncompressible blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant (the appendix) observed on ultrasound, indicated acute appendicitis. The absence of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, along with ultrasound findings of hyperemia in the appendix wall and lack of adjacent fluid collection, supported the diagnosis."
