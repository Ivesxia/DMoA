        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of abdominal pain localized in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, along with findings from the ERCP which indicated mild dilation of the common hepatic duct and absence of contrast entering the gallbladder. These findings were indicative of acute cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, with the anatomical configuration suggesting Mirizzi's syndrome."
