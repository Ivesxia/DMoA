        "final_diagnosis": "Acute perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a week-long history of abdominal pain which began in the epigastric region, poor appetite, and progressive diffuse abdominal pain with nausea. Key findings included low-grade temperatures, diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, and tachycardia. These clinical features, combined with the acute worsening of symptoms and the potential for perforation, led to the diagnosis of acute perforated appendicitis."
