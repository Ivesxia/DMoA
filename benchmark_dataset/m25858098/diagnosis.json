        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis was made based on imaging findings of wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon, along with the presence of surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. The patient presented with right flank and right lower quadrant pain, which supports this diagnosis. No other significant abnormalities were noted that would suggest alternative diagnoses."
