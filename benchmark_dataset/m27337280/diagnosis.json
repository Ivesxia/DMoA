        "final_diagnosis": "pancreatitis; ampulla stricture s/p PTC with dilation and temporary biliary drain placement",
        "differential_diagnosis": "choledocholithiasis, ampullary stenosis/stricture",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of intermittent right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, with evidence of equivocal biliary ductal dilation from prior imaging. This led to further investigation through percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, which confirmed the diagnosis of ampulla stricture following the procedure."
