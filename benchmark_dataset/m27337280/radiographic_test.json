The liver is normal in shape and contour with a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain in satisfactory position. No intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation, improved from the prior exam. An indeterminate hypodense lesion measuring approximately 8 mm in the gallbladder fossa, unchanged in size compared to the prior MRI. The pancreas, spleen, bilateral adrenal glands, kidneys, small bowel and large bowel are normal. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, likely within the normal physiologic range. No significant osseous lesions or fractures.",
