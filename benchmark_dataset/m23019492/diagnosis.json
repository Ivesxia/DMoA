        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain in the RUQ after a fatty meal, which is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. The abdominal pain was associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The presence of a distal CBD stone was identified in the ED, supporting the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's edema and vital signs indicated volume overload, which led to the diagnosis of pulmonary edema."
