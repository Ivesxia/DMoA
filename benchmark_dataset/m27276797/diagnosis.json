        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain and black tarry stools, symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Laboratory values indicated elevated liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase. Imaging studies (MRCP) showed pancreatic cysts but no acute pathology, supporting a diagnosis of pancreatitis without features of obstruction."
