By her examination date, the pain was localized to the RLQ with some pain in the left lower quadrant (LLQ). She preferred to have her knees in a flexed position and her head leaning forward. Her temperature was 102.6Â°F, and she experienced some nausea since a previous date. She noted her pain changed in intensity, and after taking over-the-counter pain medications, she felt a little bit better, but Tylenol did not help her discomfort.",
