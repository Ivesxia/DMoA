        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 2 days of right lower quadrant abdominal pain that was localized without associated gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. Imaging findings showed an enlarged tip of the appendix, possible mild hyperenhancement of the wall, and equivocal stranding in the right lower quadrant. These findings support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
