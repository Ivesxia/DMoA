        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by fever, and specific tenderness upon palpation in that region. The physical exam did not reveal any significant abdominal distension or guarding, but the exquisite tenderness in the RLQ, along with the patient's symptoms, strongly supported the diagnosis of appendicitis."
