        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by CT findings showing an enlarged and inflamed appendix with adjacent gas and a small rim-enhancing fluid collection compatible with an abscess at the base of the appendix. Additionally, the patient's symptoms included abdominal pain localized to the right side, which aligned with typical manifestations of appendicitis."
