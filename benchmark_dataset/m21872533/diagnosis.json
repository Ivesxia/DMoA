        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis with lower gastrointestinal bleeding was supported by imaging that showed active extravasation near the hepatic flexure and findings consistent with diverticula throughout the colon. The patient's presentation with bright red blood per rectum and subsequent management including angiography further supported this diagnosis."
