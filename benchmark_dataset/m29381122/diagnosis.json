        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and the CT findings of marked inflammatory change about the diverticula along the lower sigmoid. The CT scan also indicated the potential beginnings of abscess formation and thickening of the distal ileum wall, consistent with diverticulitis."
