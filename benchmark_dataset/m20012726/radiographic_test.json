There is a 5 mm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, likely a tiny hemangioma. The bile ducts show no intrahepatic biliary dilation with the CHD measuring 4 mm. The gallbladder contains many shadowing stones with echogenic foci in the gallbladder wall, suggestive of adenomyomatosis. There is no gallbladder wall thickening or distention.",
