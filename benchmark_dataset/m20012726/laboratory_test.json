There is a 5 mm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, likely a tiny hemangioma. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. The CHD measures 4 mm. The gallbladder contains many shadowing stones. There are echogenic foci in the gallbladder wall, with apparent comet tail artifact likely representing adenomyomatosis. There is no gallbladder wall thickening or distention.",
