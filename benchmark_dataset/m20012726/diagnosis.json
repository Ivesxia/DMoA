        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain, a history of cholelithiasis, and ultrasound findings of numerous shadowing stones in the gallbladder. Although there was no gallbladder wall thickening or distention noted on ultrasound, the symptoms and the presence of gallstones were significant indicators leading to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
