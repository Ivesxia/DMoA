        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT abdomen and pelvis findings indicated a dilated appendix measuring 8 mm filled with fluid, moderate circumferential wall thickening and hyperenhancement, with mild surrounding fat stranding. These findings, along with the patient's RLQ pain history and physical exam showing tenderness in the right lower quadrant, support the diagnosis of appendicitis."
