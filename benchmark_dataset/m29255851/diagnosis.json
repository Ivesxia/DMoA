        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain that worsened throughout the day, intermittent fever, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly right of midline. The CT scan findings indicated a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with fecalized material, and the presence of an appendicolith, which confirmed the diagnosis."
