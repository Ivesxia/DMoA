    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis, contained",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe, sharp, colicky pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant along with nausea and vomiting. CT imaging revealed an enlarged appendix with fluid and a hyperenhancing wall, indicating inflammation. There was a small amount of fluid adjacent to the inflamed appendix, consistent with complicated appendicitis. No free air was noted in the abdomen, supporting the diagnosis of contained perforation."
