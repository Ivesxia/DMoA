        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with nausea, which are consistent symptoms of appendicitis. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a dilated appendix measuring approximately 12 mm with wall thickening and mucosal enhancement, along with adjacent fat stranding, confirming the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Other abdominal organs appeared normal, and there was no evidence of complications such as perforation or intraabdominal fluid collection."
