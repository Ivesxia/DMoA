        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with significant right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain, decreased appetite, and tenderness in the abdomen, specifically in the RUQ. These clinical findings, along with the patient's history of high blood pressure and obesity, supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The absence of nausea, vomiting, and fever also guided the diagnostic approach."
