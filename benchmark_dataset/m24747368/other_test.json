The resistive indices on the right are 0.81, 0.67, 0.87. Spectral Doppler evaluation of the right renal artery demonstrates a delayed acceleration time without increased velocity. The left resistive indices measure 0.75, 0.84, 0.87. Spectral Doppler evaluation of the left renal artery demonstrates a mildly delayed acceleration time without increased velocity. The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance.",
