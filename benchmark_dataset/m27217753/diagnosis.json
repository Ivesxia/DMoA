        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain, which began a week prior and was characterized as worst initially with slight improvement thereafter. The CT scan revealed an inflammatory mass near the cecum, suggestive of appendicitis, along with trace free fluid in the pelvis but no signs of free air, supporting the diagnosis of contained phlegmon associated with ruptured appendicitis."
