        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 48 hours of vomiting and abdominal pain, which was initially epigastric before localizing to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and left lower quadrant (LLQ). Physical examination revealed RLQ pain, and imaging (CT scan) showed a dilated appendix (up to 12 mm), significant appendiceal fat stranding, and multiple appendicoliths, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
