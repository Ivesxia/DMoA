        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's reported abdominal pain that started after eating and subsequently radiated to the LLQ, along with tenderness in the periumbilical and RLQ areas during the physical examination. A CT scan revealed a calcific density in the appendiceal neck with marked distal fluid-filled dilatation, consistent with appendicitis."
