        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with lethargy and was found to have a subacute subdural hematoma, alongside imaging findings suggestive of emphysematous cholecystitis and acute pulmonary embolism.

Other laboratory and imaging findings raised concerns for possible pneumonia."
