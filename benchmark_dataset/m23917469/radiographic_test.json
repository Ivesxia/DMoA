Re-demonstrated large left frontoparietal encephalomalacia, likely related to old infarct. Left basal ganglia lacunar infarcts. No evidence of new hemorrhage, acute large territorial infarction, edema, or mass. Stable appearance of left basal ganglia lacunar infarcts and hypodensity within the posterior limb of the left internal capsule, likely representing old lacunar infarction.",
