        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, initially periumbilical and later migrating to the right lower quadrant, along with significant tenderness and guarding upon examination. A CT scan was performed which showed normal results besides a distended bladder. Surgery was consulted but ruled out a surgical issue due to the normal CT findings, leading to the conclusion of diverticulitis based on clinical presentation."
