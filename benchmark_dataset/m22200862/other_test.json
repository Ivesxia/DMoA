An additional hyperattenuating lesion in the liver measuring 1.2 x 2 cm could represent a flash filling hemangioma versus focal nodular hyperplasia, also unchanged from prior CT. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring 11 mm with surrounding inflammatory change and mucosal hyperemia consistent with appendicitis. A 6.3 cm hypodense rounded lesion is seen along the anterior uterine wall, likely representing a subserosal fibroid.",
