An additional 1.2 x 2 cm hyperattenuating lesion in the liver, unchanged from previous CT, could represent a flash filling hemangioma versus focal nodular hyperplasia. The left kidney demonstrates a small hypodense lesion, likely representing a cyst. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring 11 mm with surrounding inflammatory change and mucosal hyperemia consistent with appendicitis.",
