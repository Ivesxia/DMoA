            "findings": "The liver demonstrates an 8.5 x 2.8 cm hypodense lesion with hyperdensity around the periphery, which is unchanged in appearance from CT of Not specified, likely representing an hemangioma. An additional 1.2 x 2 cm hyperattenuating lesion in the liver, also unchanged from CT of Not specified, could represent a flash filling hemangioma versus focal nodular hyperplasia. The left kidney has a small hypodense lesion likely representing a cyst. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring 11 mm with surrounding inflammatory change and mucosal hyperemia consistent with appendicitis. A 6.3 cm hypodense rounded lesion is seen along the anterior uterine wall, likely representing a subserosal fibroid.",
            "changes_over_time": "The liver lesions and kidney lesion are unchanged from previous CT examinations. The findings related to the appendix indicate appendicitis."
