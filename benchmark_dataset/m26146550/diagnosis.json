        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 3-week history of worsening right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. A prior CT scan indicated mild inflammation around the colon, suggesting an initial consideration of diverticulitis. However, the final diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, confirmed by the need for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the identification of calculus of gallbladder with other cholecystitis without obstruction."
