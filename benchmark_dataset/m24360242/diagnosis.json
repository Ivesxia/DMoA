        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis with hydrops of the gallbladder and probable early necrosis of the fundus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which was constant and unremitting. His previous history of similar pain and elevated white blood cell count suggests a recurrence of biliary issues. The presence of mild to moderate RUQ tenderness during the physical examination further supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The recent consumption of fatty foods may have precipitated the current episode."
