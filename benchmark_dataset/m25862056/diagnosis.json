        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was based on the history of ongoing right upper quadrant pain, the findings from the right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed marked distension of the gallbladder with multiple shadowing gallstones, and the fact that one gallstone was lodged within the gallbladder neck. The absence of gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, along with a normal bile duct measurement, helped confirm the diagnosis."
