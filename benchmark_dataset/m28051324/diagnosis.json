        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and a history of decreased appetite and malaise, which worsened following a meal. Elevated lipase levels indicated pancreatitis, while the abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric and right upper quadrant areas. The absence of gallstones on ultrasound helped confirm the diagnosis."
