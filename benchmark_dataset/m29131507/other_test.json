            "findings": "Several calculi are identified within the lumen of the gallbladder, the largest measuring 1.0 cm x 0.9 cm. Additionally, a 1.0 cm x 1.2 cm calculus is seen impacted within the gallbladder neck/cystic duct. There is mild generalized mural thickening of the gallbladder wall. No focal nodule or mass lesion is seen arising from the gallbladder wall. A small amount of pericholecystic fluid and stranding is identified. The common bile duct is normal in caliber. No intraluminal filling defects are seen within the CBD to suggest choledocholithiasis. No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen. A small amount of free fluid is seen in the perihepatic and perisplenic areas. Heterogeneous enhancement is identified within the liver parenchyma on arterial phase imaging, which resolves on portal venous phase. No other focal parenchymal abnormality is seen within the liver on T1-weighted, T2-weighted or post-contrast imaging. The hepatic artery is patent and arises from expected anatomic location. The portal vein and hepatic veins are patent. No focal abnormality is seen in the pancreas. A tiny cortical cyst is identified at the mid pole of the left kidney measuring 0.6 cm x 0.5 cm. No other focal lesion is seen in the left kidney. The right kidney is normal. Both adrenal glands are normal in appearance. There is no significant dilatation of the visualized portions of the large bowel or small bowel. The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, left renal artery, and right renal artery are patent. An accessory right renal vein is identified. No abnormal signal is seen within the bone marrow of the visualized skeleton.",
