        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is supported by the patient's history of increasing episodes of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and emesis, along with the ultrasound findings which revealed a distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, thickened gallbladder wall, and pericholecystic fluid. These findings, combined with the absence of fever or significant complications, indicate acute cholecystitis."
