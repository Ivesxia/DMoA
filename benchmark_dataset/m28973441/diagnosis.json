        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a four-day history of substernal and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, intermittent fevers, and changes in bowel habits, including severe constipation and unusual stool appearance. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and pain on palpation in the RUQ. The ERCP findings showed minimal dilatation of the common bile duct and the presence of an impacted stone within the major papilla, which correlates with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
