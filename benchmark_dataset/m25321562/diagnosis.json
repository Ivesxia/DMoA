        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of biliary colic and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis, including epigastric pain, nausea, and a past medical history of symptomatic cholelithiasis. The absence of fever, jaundice, and other gastrointestinal disturbances, along with the necessity for surgical intervention, indicated gallstone-related pancreatitis as the most likely cause."
