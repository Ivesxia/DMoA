        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and RUQ pain following a meal, and evaluation via ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder with sludge and calculi, as well as gallbladder wall edema, indicating acute cholecystitis. Additionally, the patient's history of gallstone pancreatitis and the transfer due to concern for biliary complications support the diagnosis of transient cholangitis."
