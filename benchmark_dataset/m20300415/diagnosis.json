        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of epigastric pain radiating to the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and left upper quadrant (LUQ), associated with nausea and vomiting. CT imaging revealed multiple gallstones and mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, which are consistent with acute cholecystitis. There were no signs of pericholecystic inflammatory stranding, but the clinical presentation and imaging findings supported the diagnosis."
