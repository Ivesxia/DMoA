        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of acute onset abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), nausea, and vomiting, along with imaging findings of a mucosally-enhancing 10 mm appendix with associated periappendiceal stranding. Positive Rovsing's sign on examination also indicated appendiceal irritation."
