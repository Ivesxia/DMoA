            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "The appendix is dilated, measuring up to 1.1 cm, fluid-filled, with hyperenhancing walls. There is wall thickening and inflammation of the cecal base, likely secondary to appendicitis. Moderate periappendiceal stranding is noted. Bibasilar atelectasis is similar to prior. A 1.8 x 1.1 cm focal opacity in the right lung base adjacent to a prominent osteophyte may represent focal atelectasis but appears slightly enlarged since previous examination. Multiple sclerotic metastases are present in the pelvic bones and thoracolumbar spine vertebral bodies, several of which have slightly enlarged since previous examination.",
