            "findings": "Bibasilar atelectasis is similar to prior. 1.8 x 1.1 cm focal opacity in the right lung base adjacent to a prominent osteophyte may represent focal atelectasis but appears slightly enlarged. The appendix is dilated, measuring up to 1.1 cm, fluid filled, and has hyperenhancing walls, consistent with acute appendicitis. There is wall thickening and inflammation of the cecal base. Moderate periappendiceal stranding observed. No periappendiceal collection or extraluminal air is identified. No free abdominal fluid, pneumoperitoneum, or abdominal wall hernia. Multiple sclerotic metastases involving the pelvic bones and thoracolumbar spine vertebral bodies, several have slightly enlarged.",
            "changes_over_time": "1.8 x 1.1 cm focal opacity in the right lung base appears slightly enlarged since prior imaging. Multiple sclerotic metastases have slightly enlarged since prior imaging."
