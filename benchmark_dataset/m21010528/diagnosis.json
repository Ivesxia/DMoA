        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe epigastric pain after eating, which persisted despite initial treatment for GERD. Laboratory values showed significantly abnormal liver function tests consistent with an obstructive biliary pattern. An ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct and moderate sludge in the gallbladder, indicating an obstruction likely related to gallstones, leading to the diagnosis of Gallstone Pancreatitis."
