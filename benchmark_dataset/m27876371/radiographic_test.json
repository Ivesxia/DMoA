The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal with no lesions. Kidneys show small cortical hypodensities, stable, likely cysts. A large anterior abdominal wall hernia contains loops of nonobstructed bowel. Hypodense areas in the pelvis concern for abscesses with some fluid present and thickening of the vaginal wall.",
