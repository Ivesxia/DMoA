The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout with no evidence of focal lesions or biliary dilatation. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys are of normal size with cortical hypodensities stable from prior exams, likely cysts. A large hernia contains loops of nonobstructed bowel. There are pelvic hypodensities and possible abscesses associated with thickened vaginal wall.",
