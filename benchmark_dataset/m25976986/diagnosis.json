        "differential_diagnosis": "Alcoholic liver disease, Sclerotic rib lesion R/O primary or metastatic cancer",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, which was persistent and worsened after eating. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzymes, and imaging revealed fatty liver. The sclerotic rib lesion raised concern for possible cancer, but the primary focus was on the alcoholic pancreatitis given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and symptomatology."
