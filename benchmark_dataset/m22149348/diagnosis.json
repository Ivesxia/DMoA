        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated duodenal diverticulitis was supported by imaging findings showing a 4.5x2.5x1.5cm fluid collection posterior to the duodenum, which was considered capable of representing a diverticulum with leakage. The patient's clinical presentation included persistent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as previous imaging that revealed a perinephric collection and sigmoid colitis."
