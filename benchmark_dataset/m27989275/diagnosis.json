        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was supported by the presence of stranding and bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon surrounding an inflamed diverticulum, noted during the CT abdomen and pelvis exam. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain worsened with movement and low-grade fever further supported the diagnosis."
