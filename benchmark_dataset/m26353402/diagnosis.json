        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain that developed after eating, along with intermittent nausea and forced emesis. Physical examination revealed tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant. Given the history of similar episodes and the pattern of symptoms, acute cholecystitis was determined as the likely diagnosis, with no signs of other acute abdominal conditions present on radiographs or examination."
