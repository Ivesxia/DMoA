        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain and jaundice, with elevated bilirubin levels indicating cholestasis. The clinical picture was further supported by acute elevations in liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and leukocytosis, suggesting an inflammatory process related to gallstones causing pancreatitis and cholangitis. The history of RUQ pain after eating and subsequent fever also aligns with these diagnoses."
