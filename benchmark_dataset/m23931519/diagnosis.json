        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of severe right upper quadrant pain, gallstones observed on ultrasound, and circumferential gallbladder wall thickening and edema. Past medical history was non-contributory, which helped to focus on the acute nature of the symptoms."
