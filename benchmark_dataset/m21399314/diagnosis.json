        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain primarily in the epigastrium, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Laboratory findings indicated the presence of gram-negative rods, suggesting a bacterial infection. The clinical picture evolved to include fevers and had similarities to a previous episode of abdominal discomfort. Given the symptoms, findings, and microbiological evidence, cholecystitis was identified as the primary diagnosis."
