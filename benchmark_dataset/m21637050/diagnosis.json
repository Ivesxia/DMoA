        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with elevated lipase levels (700 on initial tests and 931 later), along with symptoms of epigastric pain and fever, suggestive of pancreatitis. CT findings indicated no acute abnormalities, which together with the elevated lipase helped firmly establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
