No focal liver lesion within the limitations of this scan. The portal and hepatic veins are patent. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, the common bile duct measures 5 mm. The pancreatic duct measures 2 mm. The gallbladder is slightly thick-walled but non-distended. There is a small amount of high T2 signal adjacent to the gallbladder. Gallstones from prior sonography are less evident now. There is a 1.4-cm lobulated cystic lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney with indeterminate appearances. Several other simple cysts are noted within both kidneys.",
