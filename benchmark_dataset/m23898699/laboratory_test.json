The portal and hepatic veins are patent. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, the common bile duct measures 5 mm, pancreatic duct measures 2 mm. Gallbladder is slightly thick-walled but non-distended with some high T2 signal adjacent; gallstones are less evident now. There is a 1.4-cm lobulated cystic lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney with indeterminate appearances, followup advised in six months.",
