        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain localized to the epigastric and right upper quadrant (RUQ), nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with symptoms of acute cholecystitis. The history of similar episodes over the past two weeks and prior pancreatitis may suggest a recurrent issue, but the acute presentation aligns with the final diagnosis."
