        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of recurrent cholelithiasis, presenting symptoms of sharp RUQ abdominal pain exacerbated by food, and laboratory findings of marked transaminitis. Ultrasound findings identified several gallbladder stones, with the largest stone appearing lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, which is consistent with cholecystitis."
