        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain migrating from the periumbilical area to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with tenderness in the RLQ and positive Rosving's sign. Imaging findings from the CT scan indicated a fluid-filled, hyperemic appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes, which are characteristic of acute appendicitis."
