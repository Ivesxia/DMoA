        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain following ingestion of food, along with imaging findings showing cholelithiasis and mildly elevated liver transaminases. The absence of biliary obstruction and severe abdominal findings further clarified the diagnosis."
