            "findings": "The liver is normal in signal intensity, without focal lesions. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct dilation. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 7 mm. The gallbladder is moderately distended and contains a few tiny gallstones. Mild gallbladder wall thickening with moderate edema and increased early enhancement is present. There is minimal pericholecytic fluid and mild hyperemia of the adjacent liver. The cystic duct is not dilated but there may be a stone at the gallbladder neck-cystic duct junction. Small focus of fundal gallbladder adenomyomatosis is seen. Small periportal lymph nodes are likely reactive. No pathologic retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen. The adrenal glands, spleen and pancreas are normal. Few tiny left renal cortical cysts and a single left renal peripelvic cyst are seen. A sub-centimeter hemorrhagic right upper pole renal cyst shows no abnormal enhancement. The stomach and imaged abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable. Scattered descending colonic diverticulosis is noted. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta is seen, without aneurysmal dilation. Minimal narrowing of the right renal artery may be due to the technique/motion artifact, however given small calcification on prior CT, borderline right renal artery stenosis cannot be excluded. The portal, splenic and superior mesenteric veins are patent. There is no ascites. No focal marrow signal abnormality is seen. Small right pleural effusion with mild right lower lobe atelectasis are noted.",
