            "findings": "Partially imaged lung bases are clear. No pleural effusion. A sub cm hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize. The liver enhances homogeneously without concerning lesions or biliary dilatation. Gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Kidneys enhance and excrete in a symmetric manner without concerning lesions or hydronephrosis. Stomach is mildly distended with ingested material. Several loops of small bowel are distended with fluid; however, there is no dilatation to suggest obstruction. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated to 1 cm, demonstrating wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding consistent with appendicitis. No drainable fluid collection or abscess. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Bladder, terminal ureters, and uterus are within normal limits. Well-circumscribed bilateral intermediate density adnexal masses likely represent mildly complex ovarian cysts. Degenerative changes are present throughout the mid to spine without concerning osteolytic or sclerotic lesions. A focus of sclerosis in the posterior body of L4, unchanged, likely represents a bone island. Surgical clips are present along the anterior abdominal wall.",
