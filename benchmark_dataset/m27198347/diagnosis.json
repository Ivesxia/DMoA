        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's right-sided abdominal pain, crampy nature of the pain, and the findings on the CT scan, which showed a fluid-filled and dilated appendix with wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding. Additionally, there was a small amount of free fluid along the distal appendix which may represent perforation."
