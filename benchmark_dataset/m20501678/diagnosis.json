        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive abdominal pain primarily in the RUQ and RLQ, associated with nausea. Past medical history and EGD findings showed prior complications related to the gastrointestinal tract, but current examination and imaging ruled out significant issues such as extraluminal leakage, which supports the considerations of diverticulitis or a contained perforation."
