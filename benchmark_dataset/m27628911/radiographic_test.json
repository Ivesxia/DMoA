Oral contrast is seen in slightly prominent small bowel loops but maximum diameter is 2.5 cm and within normal limits. Oral contrast has not reached the distal small bowel or the colon. Inflammatory/postoperative changes present in the right lower quadrant consistent with recent surgery. Tiny pockets of air are also noted, also consistent with recent surgery. No well-defined abscess collection is seen. The uterus is markedly enlarged, most likely from a large regenerative fibroid which displaces the endometrial canal.",
