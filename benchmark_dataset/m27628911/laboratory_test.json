Oral contrast is seen in slightly prominent small bowel loops but maximum diameter is 2.5 cm and within normal limits. Inflammatory/postoperative changes present in the right lower quadrant consistent with recent surgery. Tiny pockets of air noted, also consistent with recent surgery. No well-defined abscess collection is seen. The uterus is markedly enlarged, most likely from a large regenerative fibroid displacing the endometrial canal. Liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys appear normal.",
