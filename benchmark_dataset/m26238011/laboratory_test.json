            "findings": "Lower Thorax: Small right and trace left pleural effusions with adjacent relaxation atelectasis are not significantly changed since 2 days prior. Liver: The liver is normal and homogeneous in signal intensity and enhancement. Incidental pseudo lipoma of Glisson's capsule at the hepatic dome. No concerning lesions. The portal veins and hepatic veins are patent. Trace perihepatic, perisplenic, and pelvic fluid. There are thin septations in the perihepatic fluid. Biliary: Status-post cholecystectomy. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. No intraluminal filling defects. No abnormal peribiliary enhancement. No extravasation of the biliary contrast agent. Incidental note is made of variant intrahepatic ductal anatomy with the right posterior hepatic duct communicating directly with the left hepatic duct. Pancreas: The pancreas is normal in signal intensity and enhancement. Incidental 3 mm cystic lesion in the proximal pancreatic tail likely reflecting a small side branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (series 8, image 4; series 10, image 5). No enhancing lesions. Spleen: The spleen is normal in size, signal intensity, and enhancement. No focal lesions. Adrenal Glands: The adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. No nodules. Kidneys: The kidneys are normal and symmetric in size, shape, and nephrogram. Small left upper pole simple cyst. No concerning lesions. No hydronephrosis. Gastrointestinal Tract: The stomach and partially imaged loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable. Lymph Nodes: No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Vasculature: No abdominal aortic aneurysm. Incidental replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery. Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: No suspicious osseous lesions. The abdominal wall is unremarkable.",
