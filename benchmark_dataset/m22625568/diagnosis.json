    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT scan revealed a distended fluid-filled appendix with an obstructive appendicolith and enhancing wall, as well as surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. Other abdominal organs and structures, including the bowel and pelvic organs, appeared normal, ruling out alternative diagnoses."
