        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting, and the ultrasound findings revealing a gallstone in the gallbladder neck without significant distension or pericholecystic fluid. The absence of other significant findings on ultrasound and the typical symptoms align with acute cholecystitis."
