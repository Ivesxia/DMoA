A gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder is noted which did not move with position change. A second area with shadowing in the vicinity of the gallbladder neck likely represents air in the duodenal bulb, less likely a shadowing gallstone. The visualized pancreas appears unremarkable. The main portal vein is patent. There is no free fluid within the right upper quadrant.",
