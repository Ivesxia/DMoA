        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of diverticulosis, the presentation of severe left-sided abdominal pain, and the findings from the CT scan showing multiple diverticula with fat stranding near the ascending colon support the diagnosis of diverticulitis. The absence of any extraluminal air or fluid collection further corroborates this diagnosis."
