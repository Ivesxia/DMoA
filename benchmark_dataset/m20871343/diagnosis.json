        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a one week history of worsening right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, associated chills, and no previous similar symptoms, which clinically suggested acute cholecystitis. The absence of nausea, vomiting, and fever also directed the diagnosis. The intraoperative findings and cholangiogram further supported the diagnosis."
