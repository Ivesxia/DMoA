        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe epigastric and right-sided abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after eating, and had a history of a similar episode of abdominal pain one month prior. Imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis) revealed a distended gallbladder without pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema, leading to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
