        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was supported by the presentation of epigastric pain, nausea, and an elevated lipase level of 582. The abdominal ultrasound findings did not indicate significant abnormalities that could explain the symptoms, and no other potential causes (like gallstones or biliary obstruction) were identified."
