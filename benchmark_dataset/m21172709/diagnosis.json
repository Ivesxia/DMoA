        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain primarily located in the suprapubic region, which was somewhat relieved with voiding. He reported subjective fevers and mild tenderness in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant (LLQ) regions during the physical exam. The absence of nausea, vomiting, and a history of regular bowel movements contributed to ruling out other conditions, leading to the conclusion of diverticulitis."
