        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by imaging findings including a mildly distended gallbladder with hyperenhancement and mucosal irregularity, pericholecystic fluid, and the presence of luminal sludge and stones. These findings align with the patient's clinical presentation of severe upper abdominal pain, particularly in the RUQ."
