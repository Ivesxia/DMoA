The right ovary does not appear edematous, and internal flow is demonstrated. No evidence of torsion. The left ovary is unchanged, with a 2.0 cm isoechoic structure likely representing an early hemorrhagic cyst or endometrioma. A tubular blind-ending structure consistent with the appendix is present, appearing normal, with a small amount of fluid surrounding it.",
