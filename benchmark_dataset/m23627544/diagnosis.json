        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis with appendectomy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of sharp and crampy abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, along with nausea and vomiting for two days, suggested acute abdomen. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant and possible rebound or guarding, which raised suspicion for appendicitis. The imaging findings of a tubular blind-ending structure consistent with the appendix, coupled with the presence of fluid surrounding the structure, further supported the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
