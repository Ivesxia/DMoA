        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's acute abdominal pain, with a progression from a dull pain at the navel to sharp pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The CT scan revealed a dilated and fluid-filled appendix measuring up to 13 mm with thickened and hyperemic walls, consistent with acute appendicitis. No evidence of perforation or free intra-abdominal air was noted."
