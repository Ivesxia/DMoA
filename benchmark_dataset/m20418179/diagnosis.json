        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric abdominal pain worsening over a week, associated with nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. An upper endoscopy indicated esophagitis and a hiatal hernia, but the nature of the abdominal pain felt different from typical GERD symptoms. The CT scan of the pancreas showed no significant abnormalities directly in the pancreas, yet the clinical presentation and the findings led to the final diagnosis of pancreatitis."
