        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset right flank pain and was found to have elevated lipase levels (122), which supports the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Imaging via CT did not show evidence of stones but revealed a soft tissue lesion near the hernia repair site, supporting the need for further evaluation for possible differential considerations."
