No renal or ureteral stones are identified. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A 1.7 x 2.6 cm soft tissue lesion identified in the deep right inguinal region, underlying the right inguinal hernia repair site, is similar compared to the prior MRI. Lung bases demonstrate bilateral, plate-like atelectasis.",
