        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and right upper quadrant pain after two prior episodes of biliary colic, and underwent an ultrasound that revealed a distended gallbladder with a large stone in the gallbladder neck. The clinical presentation, ultrasound findings, and the patient's history of symptomatic cholelithiasis supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
