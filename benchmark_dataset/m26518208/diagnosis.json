    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "possible pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, consistent with a history of cholangitis. Imaging revealed pneumobilia and no significant ductal dilatation. Given her presentation of abdominal pain radiating to the back with accompanying nausea and her complex surgical history, the likelihood of pancreatitis was considered."
