Lung volumes remain low. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Unchanged mediastinal widening, likely related to low lung volumes. Worsening pulmonary edema, mild to moderate in extent with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Focal opacity in the periphery of the right mid-to-upper lung field, potentially reflecting an infectious process. No pneumothorax evident.",
