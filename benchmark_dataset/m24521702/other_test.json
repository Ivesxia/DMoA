Lung volumes remain low. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Unchanged mediastinal widening, likely related to low lung volumes. Worsening pulmonary edema, now mild to moderate in extent with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Focal opacity within the periphery of the right mid-to-upper lung field could reflect an infectious process. No pneumothorax is clearly evident.",
