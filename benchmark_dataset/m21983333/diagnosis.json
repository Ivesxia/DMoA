        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain that started around the umbilical region and moved to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant without rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a fluid-filled blind-ending tubular structure extending from the base of the cecum, which is suggestive of acute appendicitis."
