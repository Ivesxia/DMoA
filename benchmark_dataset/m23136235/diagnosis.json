        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 48 hours of band-like epigastric pain and bilious emesis, which led to a diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. Ultrasound findings confirmed the presence of multiple small gallstones in a contracted gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis, and the diagnostic process considered the patient's past medical history and presenting symptoms."
