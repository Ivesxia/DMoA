        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with interim right upper quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain, which evolved to become constant. The ultrasound indicated gallbladder disease, supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and additionally noted the presence of an obstructing gallstone. ERCP attempts to remove the stone were unsuccessful, leading to surgical intervention with laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
