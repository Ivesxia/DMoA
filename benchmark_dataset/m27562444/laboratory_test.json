Normal gallbladder with no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. Noted a duplicated right renal collecting system. The base of the appendix is dilated to 9 mm, compatible with acute appendicitis. There is para-appendiceal stranding, no extraluminal air, and no free fluid.",
