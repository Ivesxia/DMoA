        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sharp, stabbing abdominal pain that initially started as paraumbilical and later migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Associated symptoms included nausea, but the patient did not have fever or changes in bowel function. Physical examination revealed tenderness over McBurney's point, and CT imaging showed a dilated appendix (9 mm) with para-appendiceal stranding, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
