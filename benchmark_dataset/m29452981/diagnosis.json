        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's symptoms, such as waxing and waning lower abdominal pain and fever, alongside imaging findings from a CT scan that indicated a gallbladder abscess and cholestasis. The presence of gas in the gallbladder and multiple gallstones further reinforced the diagnosis."
