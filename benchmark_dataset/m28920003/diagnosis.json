        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed focal subtle hypodensity of the pancreatic neck and head, which is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient's history of binge drinking and the presence of abdominal pain exacerbated by food support this diagnosis."
