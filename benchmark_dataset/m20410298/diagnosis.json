        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that began periumbilically and later localized to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by subjective fever and nausea. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a fluid-filled appendix measuring 8 mm in diameter with hyperemia of the mucosa, along with trace mesenteric fat stranding. The absence of fluid collection, pneumoperitoneum, or free fluid further supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
