        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by a CT scan showing a dilated appendix measuring up to 1.3 cm with significant surrounding stranding and phlegmonous change, consistent with appendicitis. The patient's symptoms of severe right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and low-grade fever corroborated the diagnosis."
