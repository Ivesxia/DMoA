    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal cramping and symptoms consistent with appendicitis, including a retrocecal appendix that was fluid-filled and distended, along with circumferential thickening of the appendiceal wall and periappendiceal fat stranding. These imaging findings suggested acute appendicitis, and some fluid near the appendix raised suspicion for possible early perforation."
