        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain that initially began in the epigastric region and later localized to the left lower quadrant. Accompanying symptoms included nausea and bilious vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lower quadrant, which further supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Imaging results indicated no abnormalities in the chest, which helped to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain."
