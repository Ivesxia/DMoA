        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1-day history of right upper quadrant pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination indicated tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a distended gallbladder with gallstones but no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, which suggests acute cholecystitis."
