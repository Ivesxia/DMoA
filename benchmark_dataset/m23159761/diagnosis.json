        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain after a fatty meal, which was constant and worsened with eating. There were no accompanying symptoms such as fever or gastrointestinal distress. The physical examination revealed right upper quadrant tenderness, which, along with the clinical history, indicated acute cholecystitis. The decision for surgery was likely influenced by this presentation."
