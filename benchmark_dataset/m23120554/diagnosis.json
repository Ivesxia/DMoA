        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which started after a headache and localized to the right upper quadrant. The symptoms, in conjunction with the patient's history of steroid use and chronic adrenal insufficiency, along with the absence of similar episodes in the past, led to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Post-operative ileus was also noted following laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
