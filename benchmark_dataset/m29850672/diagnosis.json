        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's upper abdominal pain localizing to the right upper quadrant (RUQ), ultrasound findings of a stone lodged within the neck of the gallbladder, and the presence of related symptoms such as nausea and decreased appetite. The absence of fever and jaundice, along with no significant findings on other abdominal organs, suggested acute cholecystitis as the primary diagnosis."
