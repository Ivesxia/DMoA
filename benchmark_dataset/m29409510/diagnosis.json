        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with appendicitis. CT imaging revealed a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant with a direct communication to a dilated appendiceal tip, supporting the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. Additional findings included regional peritonitis and mild wall thickening of the small bowel, corroborating the diagnosis."
