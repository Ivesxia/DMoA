            "findings": "The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is a subcentimeter hypodensity in segment 8, too small to characterize on CT. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. The spleen shows normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Spleen is enlarged at 16.0 cm. The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. A subcentimeter hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney is too small to characterize by CT, but likely represents a cyst. No hydronephrosis is seen. There is no perinephric abnormality. No bowel obstruction is seen. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening and fat stranding. The appendix is distended with wall thickening and dilated to 1.0 cm, with surrounding fat stranding. There is no fluid collection identified. There is no free intraperitoneal air. The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.",
