        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of pancreatitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of upper abdominal pain and elevated lipase levels, which are indicative of pancreatic inflammation. The CT abdomen showed no suspicious lesions and suggested that the transplant liver had mild fatty infiltration, while other abdominal organs appeared normal. The absence of significant findings in the evaluation of liver blood flow and the history of liver transplant contributed to the conclusion."
