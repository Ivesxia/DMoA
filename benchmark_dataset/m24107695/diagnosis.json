        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by imaging findings showing a tubular hyperenhancing fluid-filled structure in the right lower quadrant with features consistent with an inflamed appendix. Additionally, there was an involuting corpus luteal cyst within the right ovary identified on the imaging, but no evidence of appendiceal perforation or abscess formation."
