        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain that progressively worsened and was associated with nonbilious emesis and nausea. CT imaging of the abdomen revealed a dilated appendix measuring up to 9 cm with surrounding fat stranding, which is indicative of appendicitis. There was no evidence of perforation or other complications."
