        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain, which began as mid-abdominal pain, along with active vomiting and subjective chills. A CT scan revealed a dilated appendix with hyperemic wall, surrounding fat stranding, and a hyperdense focus suggestive of an appendicolith. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis. No bowel obstruction was noted, and there was no imaging evidence of perforation or abscess."
