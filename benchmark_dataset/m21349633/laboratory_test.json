Trace pericholecystic fluid is likely due to third spacing. The appendix is dilated to 15 mm with hyperemic wall, surrounding fat stranding, and small amount of free fluid. Focal irregularities of the wall of the appendix could suggest early perforation, although no pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis is appreciated. There is trace fluid in the pelvis. No enlarged lymph nodes or aggressive osseous lesions.",
