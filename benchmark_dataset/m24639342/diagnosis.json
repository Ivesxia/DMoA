        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the presence of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, distended gallbladder containing sludge and stones, mild gallbladder wall thickening and edema, as well as a positive sonographic Murphy's sign. The patient's history of gallstones further corroborates this diagnosis."
