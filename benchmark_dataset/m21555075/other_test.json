The common bile duct is normal in caliber and contour, without evidence of filling defects, measuring approximately 5 mm in caliber. Mild prominence of the intrahepatic ducts centrally; otherwise unremarkable. No periductal enhancement and no liver lesions. Right kidney has a hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted sequences that is uniformly dark on T1-weighted sequences, with two foci of nodular enhancement and a suggestion of an enhancing thick septation. Findings are nonspecific; cystic renal neoplasm cannot be excluded. Left kidney is unremarkable. No hydronephrosis. Abdominal aorta and its major branches are normal.",
