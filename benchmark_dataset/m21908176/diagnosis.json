        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, distension, and urinary retention. A CT scan was performed to rule out renal stones, which instead showed bowel dilation, leading to the suspicion of an appendiceal issue. The history of crampy abdominal pain, inability to pass flatus, and tenderness in the abdominal examination supported the diagnosis of ruptured appendicitis."
