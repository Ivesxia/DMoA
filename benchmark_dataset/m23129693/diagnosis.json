        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric/lower chest pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, and imaging studies including a CT scan and RUQ ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid, indicative of inflammation. These findings, alongside the patient's clinical symptoms, supported the diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis."
