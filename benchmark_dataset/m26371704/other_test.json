There has been interval resolution of the fluid component of this collection with minimal residual air. The previously described intramural abscess within the sigmoid colon has decreased in size and now contains only a small amount of gas (2:65). The retrouterine abscess is grossly stable measuring up to 3.1 x 2.2 cm containing fluid and a small amount of gas (2:70). There is no new or enlarging abscess. Extensive inflammatory changes surrounding the sigmoid colon are otherwise similar to the prior study.",
