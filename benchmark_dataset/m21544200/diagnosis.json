        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, subjective fevers, nausea, and malaise. The CT scan revealed an inflamed appendix with local fat stranding and a measurement of 8 mm in diameter, which together with the elevated white blood cell count (WBC of 11.2) confirmed the diagnosis. No other competing diagnoses were specified."
