        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis with Common Bile Duct stricture was supported by the patient's known history of alcoholism and new onset diabetes, along with presenting symptoms such as weakness, malaise, vomiting, and diarrhea. Imaging studies showed a large non-enhancing area in the pancreatic head consistent with necrosis, and a stent was noted in the common bile duct. Laboratory findings revealed elevated creatinine and bilirubin levels, indicating possible complications related to pancreatitis."
