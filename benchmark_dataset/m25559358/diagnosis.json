        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis was indicated by the patient's severe abdominal pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, and findings on CT imaging showing a fluid collection with gas in the left flank, suggesting an abscess likely related to diverticulitis. Additionally, the patient had other complications including small bowel obstruction and fecal impaction, which further supported the diagnosis."
