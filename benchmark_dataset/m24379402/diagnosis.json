        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of mid-epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with a history of chronic C. diff and recent bouts of emesis, supports the diagnosis of pancreatitis. The ultrasound findings indicated no peripancreatic fluid collections or pancreatic ductal dilatation, but the clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with pancreatitis."
