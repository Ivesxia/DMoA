        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's abdominal pain started as periumbilical pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, consistent with acute appendicitis. CT imaging revealed thickening of the appendix to 1.2 cm with a thick, hyperemic wall and surrounding fat stranding, but no evidence of perforation, supporting the diagnosis."
