        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of diffuse upper abdominal pain and nausea following the consumption of a salad. Laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase levels. Imaging studies, including a CT abdomen, showed an enhancing gallbladder wall with mild pericholecystic fluid, consistent with acute cholecystitis."
