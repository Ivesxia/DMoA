        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, indicating pancreatitis. The presence of chills, fever, and leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, which aligns with the diagnosis of acute blood stream infection. Imaging studies ruled out other acute intra-abdominal processes."
