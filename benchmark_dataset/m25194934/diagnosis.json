        "final_diagnosis": "Sigmoid diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by the presence of marked sigmoid colonic wall thickening, mucosal hyperemia, extensive fat stranding, and a pocket of fluid with small foci of air suggestive of early abscess formation, all observed in the CT scan. The patient's symptoms of worsening lower abdominal pain, localized tenderness, and a history of sigmoid diverticulosis further supported this diagnosis."
