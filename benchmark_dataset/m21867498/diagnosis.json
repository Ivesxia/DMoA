        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included epigastric pain, which spread to the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and tenderness upon palpation. The CT scan revealed a dilated appendix measuring approximately 14 mm in diameter that did not fill with enteric contrast, confirming the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of perforation, supporting the diagnosis."
