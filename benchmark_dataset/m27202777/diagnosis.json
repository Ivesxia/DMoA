        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged appendix measuring up to 10 mm with mural thickening and mucosal hyperemia, along with adjacent fat stranding. Although the examination favored acute diverticulitis with micro perforation, the findings supported the final diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
