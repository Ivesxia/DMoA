        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis was supported by abdominal CT findings, which demonstrated inflammation, wall thickening, and extraluminal air at the proximal-to-mid sigmoid colon consistent with perforation. Clinical presentation included abdominal cramps, fecal urgency, yellowish emesis with occasional blood, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant, further contributing to the diagnosis."
