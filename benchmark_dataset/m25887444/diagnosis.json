        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive abdominal pain that transitioned to the mid-pelvic area, characterized as sharp and crampy, particularly after defecation. There was tenderness in the pelvic area during the physical examination, and the patient's fever of 100.8 developed while in the emergency department, which supports the diagnosis of diverticulitis. The absence of acute abnormalities on the CT scan suggests the need for further assessment rather than outright exclusion of diverticulitis."
