        "final_diagnosis": "ERCP related pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed chest pain following an ERCP procedure, which is consistent with ERCP related pancreatitis. The pain was similar to previous episodes and was not relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin, suggesting a cardiac cause was unlikely given the EKG showed no acute changes."
