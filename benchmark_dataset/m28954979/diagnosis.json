        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified, although appendiceal phlegmon and acute appendicitis were considered.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by the presence of a phlegmonous soft tissue mass in the right to mid pelvis on CT, which was attributed to a likely ruptured appendix. There were significant inflammatory changes and fat stranding in the area, indicating an acute process. The patient exhibited right lower quadrant tenderness but no peritoneal signs, and additional symptoms such as fever and gastrointestinal distress were absent."
