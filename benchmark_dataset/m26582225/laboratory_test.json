            "findings": "Sub-centimeter hypodensities in segment 4a and segment 6 of the liver are too small to accurately characterize but could be cysts or biliary hamartomas. The liver parenchyma otherwise demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. No peripancreatic stranding. The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout. The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrograms. No evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. The appendix is dilated up to 11 mm with wall thickening and mild hyperemia. There is surrounding mild to moderate fat stranding and trace free fluid along the right pericolic gutter.",
