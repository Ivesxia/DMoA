        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with fluid collection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging findings from the CT pelvis which showed a gas and fluid collection medial to the sigmoid, significant fat stranding, and indications of intra-abdominal free air, consistent with perforated diverticulitis. The patient's history of abdominal pain, particularly in the right lower quadrant, along with her lethargy, also supported this diagnosis."
