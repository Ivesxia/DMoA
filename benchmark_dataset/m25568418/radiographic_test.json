The gas and fluid collection medial to the sigmoid measures 4.1 x 3.8 x 4.5 cm, significantly smaller than previous but slightly increased in size compared to an earlier measurement of 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.9 cm. A smaller fluid collection to the right of the main collection measures 2.3 x 2.1 cm and is unchanged from prior. Significant fat stranding in the surrounding pelvis is stable. Residual intra-abdominal free air is slightly decreased in size compared with the previous exam. There are no dilated loops of bowel.",
