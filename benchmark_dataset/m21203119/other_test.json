            "findings": "The liver is not nodular in contour and does not demonstrate any loss of signal on out-of-phase T1-weighted images to suggest the presence of hepatic steatosis. There are three well-circumscribed T2 hyperintense lesions in segment VIII, segment VI/VII, and segment VI, consistent with simple cysts or hamartomas. No concerning liver lesions are seen. The hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. The portal vein and hepatic veins are patent. On the most delayed available phase post-contrast, the liver is somewhat heterogenous in signal intensity, possibly due to congestion. No biliary duct dilatation; the gallbladder is surgically absent. The common bile duct is not dilated measuring 4 mm. There is a small retained stone in the distal CBD measuring 4 x 4 mm.",
