        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and episodes of vomiting. The absence of fever or other systemic symptoms, alongside the acute nature of the presentation, suggested a gallbladder pathology, confirmed as acute cholecystitis, leading to the procedure of laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
