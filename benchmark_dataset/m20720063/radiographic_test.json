There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, but the common bile duct is more significantly dilated measuring up to 10 mm. The gallbladder is distended with mild wall edema. No gallstones seen. The pancreatic duct is prominent, measuring up to 3 mm. The main portal vein is patent with normal flow.",
