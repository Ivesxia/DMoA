        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset abdominal pain and nausea, described as a burning sensation in the epigastric region, which was unrelieved by Tums unlike previous episodes of GERD. Abdominal pain became constant and sharp, radiating to sides and upper back, accompanied by episodes of bilious emesis and inability to eat or drink. The history of significant alcohol abuse and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis led to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis."
