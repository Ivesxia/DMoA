        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a <24 hour history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain described as sharp and stabbing, occurring soon after eating dinner. Associated symptoms included chills and nausea but no fever. Physical examination revealed minimally tender RUQ with no rebound or guarding, and imaging showed stool-filled loops of the large bowel but no free air under the diaphragm, supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
