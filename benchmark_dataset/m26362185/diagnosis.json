        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that began as crampy and diffuse, then localized to the bilateral lower abdominal quadrants, with the right quadrant being more affected. Accompanying symptoms included fever, but no nausea or vomiting. The examination showed tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen. These findings, along with the gradual progression of symptoms and the absence of other gastrointestinal issues, supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
