        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening sharp lower abdominal pain, fever, and episodes of emesis, which were indicative of an acute abdomen. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness with focal tenderness in the left lower quadrant. The acute onset of symptoms combined with a history of similar pain episodes and laboratory findings led to the diagnosis of ruptured appendicitis with peritonitis."
