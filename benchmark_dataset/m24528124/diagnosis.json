        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain, which was supported by the CT findings of wall thickening of the sigmoid and distal descending colon, adjacent fat stranding, enhancing diverticulae, and a small amount of adjacent free fluid, consistent with diverticulitis. Past medical history of diverticulosis was a significant factor in the diagnosis."
