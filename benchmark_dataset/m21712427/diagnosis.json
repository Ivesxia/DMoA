        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain localized in the right upper quadrant, episodes of emesis, and fever. An abdominal ultrasound showed a large stone within the gallbladder lumen associated with gallbladder wall thickening, which is indicative of acute cholecystitis. The absence of pericholecystic fluid and other related abnormalities further supported this diagnosis."
