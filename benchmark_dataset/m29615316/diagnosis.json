        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and the development of constant pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The CT abdomen with contrast revealed a retrocecal appendix measuring 10-mm with significant periappendiceal fat stranding, and trace free fluid in the right paracolic gutter, indicating inflammation but no perforation."
