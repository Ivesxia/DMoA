The epicenter of inflammation is centered around the ascending colon. The terminal ileum is unremarkable. No associated diverticulum is present. The appendix is normal containing oral contrast and locules of gas. A punctate appendicolith is seen within the appendiceal tip. Subtle fat stranding adjacent to the appendiceal tip is likely secondary to adjacent inflammation.",
