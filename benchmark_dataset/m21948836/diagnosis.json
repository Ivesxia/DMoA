        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, along with imaging findings of gallbladder wall thickening, edema, common bile duct dilatation, and the results of the MRCP suggesting a few areas of narrowing and dilatation of the biliary tree, support the diagnosis of cholecystitis. No evidence of choledocholithiasis or pancreatitis was found."
