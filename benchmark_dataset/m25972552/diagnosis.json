        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, the presence of an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck as seen in the ultrasound, the gallbladder wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid. The patient's symptoms of nausea and non-bloody vomiting further suggested gastrointestinal distress. Additionally, E Coli bacteremia was identified as a significant finding possibly related to the cholecystitis."
