            "findings": "The lung bases are clear with no focal hepatic lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, both adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. The portal venous, systemic venous, and systemic arterial system of the abdomen and pelvis are normal. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The stomach and small bowel are normal. There is appendicitis with the appendix measuring about 3.4 x 2.4 cm at the origin of the cecal base and 3.5 x 3.4 cm at its mid portion at the level of the appendicolith. There is associated periappendiceal phlegmonous fat stranding, most pronounced between the appendix and the right psoas muscle. There is no free air. A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis. The prostate gland, urinary bladder, and seminal vesicles are normal without pelvic lymphadenopathy, and a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. A benign appearing (likely non-ossifying fibroma) bone lesion is seen at the right proximal femur.",
