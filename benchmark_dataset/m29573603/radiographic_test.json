The gallbladder is collapsed, no fluid collection adjacent to gallbladder, no intrahepatic biliary duct dilation, persistent expected intrahepatic pneumobilia, two small subcapsular fluid collections just superior to the percutaneous drain in the right lobe of the liver, the largest 15 x 13 mm unchanged, the smaller adjacent lesion smaller measuring 7 x 3 mm, previously 10 x 4 mm. The pancreas is atrophic with scattered areas of calcification compatible with sequela of chronic pancreatitis, degree of mild peripancreatic stranding unchanged. There is persistent wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum, previous wall thickening of the right colon appears improved. Mild stable perihepatic and perisplenic ascites, mild superior compression deformity of T12 unchanged since the prior study.",
