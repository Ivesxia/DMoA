        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain following ERCP, fever, elevated WBC count, and worsening abdominal pain. CT scan showed pneumobilia, a gas collection, and high-density fluid indicating a possible subcapsular hematoma. The septic shock aligns with the diagnosis of cholecystitis, compounded by severe Clostridium difficile infection leading to ileus."
