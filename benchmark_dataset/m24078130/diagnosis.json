        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, which revealed a dilated appendix measuring 9 mm that is fluid filled with periappendiceal stranding. These findings, along with the patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain and tenderness in the suprapubic region extending to the right groin, led to the final diagnosis."
