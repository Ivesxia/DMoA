        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was suggested by the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, alongside the presence of leukocytosis (WBC of 13) and fever (temperature up to 100). The patient's history of gastrointestinal issues and the absence of obstruction or ileus on imaging supported this diagnosis."
