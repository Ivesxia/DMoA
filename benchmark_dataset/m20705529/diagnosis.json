        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain that acutely worsened and was associated with symptoms of decreased oral intake and nausea. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a mildly thickened appendix measuring 9 mm in diameter without surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. There were no indications of other abdominal pathologies that could explain the symptoms."
