        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis is supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant, associated chills, and tenderness upon examination. A prior colonoscopy revealed diverticular disease. The CT abdomen showed extensive fat stranding, fluid surrounding a focal segment of the colon, wall edema, and diverticula, consistent with diverticulitis."
