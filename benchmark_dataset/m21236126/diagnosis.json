        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset epigastric pain, sharp in nature, and associated with episodes of non-bloody vomiting and nausea. Notably elevated lipase levels (5290), together with abdominal tenderness, indicated pancreatitis. The ultrasound findings revealed a gallstone in the gallbladder, but the pancreas was predominantly unremarkable, suggesting that the pancreatitis could be related to biliary causes."
