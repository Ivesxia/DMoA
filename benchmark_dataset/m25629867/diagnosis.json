        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset right epigastric/RUQ pain, sharp and constant in nature, that began after eating. The pain radiated toward the shoulder and was associated with episodes of emesis. Past episodes of similar pain and a significant history of attacks also suggested a recurrent issue. No evidence of fever or gastrointestinal bleeding helped narrow the focus to gallbladder-related pathology."
