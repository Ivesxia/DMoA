        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and physical examination findings of tenderness in the right lower quadrant. The CT scan revealed multiple loculated rim-enhancing fluid collections in the right lower quadrant, extensive fat stranding around a dilated fluid-filled structure likely representing an inflamed and ruptured appendix, confirming the diagnosis."
