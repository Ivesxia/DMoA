The common bile duct measures 4 mm in diameter. The gallbladder is mildly distended and there are numerous layering gallstones as well as sludge which floats in a linear fashion on decubitus images. The gallbladder is otherwise thin-walled without pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic Murphy's sign is negative. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The pancreatic head and body are unremarkable. The tail is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas. Limited view of the right kidney is unremarkable without hydronephrosis.",
