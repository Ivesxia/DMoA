        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain that began epigastrically and moved to the right upper quadrant (RUQ), accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and chills. An ultrasound identified a 2.0 cm gallstone in the gallbladder with mobile sludge, indicating acute cholecystitis despite no wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. This presentation, in conjunction with the history of recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis, supported the diagnosis."
