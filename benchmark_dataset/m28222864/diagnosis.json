    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, particularly in the right lower quadrant, along with fevers and chills. CT findings showed a blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant with surrounding inflammation and a small appendicolith, supporting the diagnosis of appendicitis. The absence of free air suggested no current perforation despite the diagnosis."
