        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by significantly elevated lipase levels (5556), ultrasound findings of a distended gallbladder with small stones and sludge, and evidence of pancreatic edema on MRCP. Additionally, pericholecystic hyperemia and gallbladder wall edema pointed to a diagnosis consistent with cholecystitis."
