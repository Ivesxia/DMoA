        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pancreatitis was suggested by elevated lipase levels (198) and is consistent with the patient's abdominal pain and recent complex medical history, including septic shock and gallbladder issues. The absence of other significant findings like fever or leukocytosis, alongside stable vitals, also supported this diagnosis."
