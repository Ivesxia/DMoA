        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, elevated liver function tests (ALT 347, AST 393), significantly elevated lipase (1632), and imaging findings indicating intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation without evidence of choledocholithiasis. Additionally, the CT findings of a slightly edematous pancreas with minimal surrounding inflammatory change further corroborated this diagnosis."
