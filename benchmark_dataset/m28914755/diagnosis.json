        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's sudden onset of sharp mid-abdominal pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and imaging results that indicated a 9 mm appendiceal diameter with fluid and possible mild wall enhancement. Additional findings included minimal fat stranding around the appendix, suggesting inflammation."
