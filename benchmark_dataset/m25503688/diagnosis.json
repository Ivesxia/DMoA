        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with one day of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain associated with nausea and vomiting, without any prior similar episodes. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RUQ, which, combined with the presentation and absence of alternative explanations (e.g., fever, jaundice), supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
