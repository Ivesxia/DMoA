Retrocardiac opacities are new since prior and could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Biapical pleuroparenchymal thickening is again seen. Small bilateral pleural effusions are suspected. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no evidence of free air below the diaphragm.",
