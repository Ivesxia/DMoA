        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, particularly in the right lower quadrant, which was reported to have worsened over a month. The physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants without distension. Abdominal radiographs showed no signs of bowel obstruction, free air, or acute osseous abnormalities, along with a noted decrease in stool burden, suggesting a diagnosis of diverticulitis amidst the patient's history of chronic constipation."
