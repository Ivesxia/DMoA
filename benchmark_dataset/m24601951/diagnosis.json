        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with intermittent epigastric pain and nausea, which worsened in frequency and severity. Ultrasound findings indicated mild gallbladder distension with mobile gallstones and mild gallbladder wall edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis. Other causes such as esophageal reflux were considered but not confirmed as the main diagnosis."
