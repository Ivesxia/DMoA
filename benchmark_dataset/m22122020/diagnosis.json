        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain, which were consistent with cholecystitis. The pain was severe enough to wake her from sleep and was associated with chills, nausea, and vomiting, aligning with clinical signs of acute cholecystitis. The patient also had a history of gallbladder issues and was scheduled for a cholecystectomy, further supporting the diagnosis."
