        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patient's history of gallstones, elevated lipase levels (>1000), abdominal ultrasound findings of gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening, as well as MRCP findings indicating minimal gallbladder wall edema and thickening. Choledocolithiasis was indicated by the presence of a stone in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct."
