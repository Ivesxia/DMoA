            "findings": "The gallbladder is distended with equivocal wall edema. There is cholelithiasis and small amount of gallbladder sludge. There is a 1.8 cm gallbladder neck stone which was not movable on realtime scanning and on decubitus positioning, suggesting impaction. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The CBD measures 1.3 mm. There is no pericholecystic fluid with the gallbladder wall measuring 2 mm. However, some of the images suggest there may be edema in the gallbladder wall. Sonographic Murphy sign was present, elicited by two independent investigators. The remainder of the liver is normal in echogenicity and texture without focal hepatic masses or lesions. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.",
