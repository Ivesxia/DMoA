        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 10 days of intermittent right lower quadrant pain, fever, anorexia, and other systemic symptoms, which are characteristic of appendicitis. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the right lower quadrant, which further supported the diagnosis. Additionally, negative signs for other abdominal issues, such as no masses or organomegaly, also guided the reasoning towards perforated appendicitis."
