        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), which worsened after eating, and imaging findings from a CT scan showing cholelithiasis in a distended gallbladder. Additionally, the patient had elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, indicating possible infection or inflammation."
