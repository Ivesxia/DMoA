    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which was sudden in onset and associated with one episode of emesis. The ultrasound findings showed numerous gallstones within the gallbladder, mild wall thickening, and trace pericholecystic fluid, indicating inflammation consistent with acute cholecystitis. The patient's past history of RUQ pain after heavy meals suggests a chronic gallbladder issue."
