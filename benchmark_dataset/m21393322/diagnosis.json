        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain that worsened over time and no gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastric area but no significant findings that would suggest alternative diagnoses. The clinical presentation was consistent with acute appendicitis, leading to the surgical intervention."
