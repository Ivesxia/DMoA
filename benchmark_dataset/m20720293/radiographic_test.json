            "changes_over_time": "The 5-mm calcified granuloma, fibrotic changes, bleb, 7-mm hypodensity in the pancreatic head, 9-mm lesion in the pancreatic tail, and the upper pole of the left kidney area were unchanged. There has been essential resolution of the marked bowel dilatation compared to the prior study."
