        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's history of acute abdominal pain, physical examination revealing tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and imaging findings of multiple gallstones within the gallbladder along with pericholecystic fluid. The pancreas showed normal signal intensity and enhancement on imaging, ruling out other acute pancreatic conditions."
