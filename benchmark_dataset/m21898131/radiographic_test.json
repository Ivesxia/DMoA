            "findings": "Visualized lung bases are clear with no pleural or pericardial effusion. A 2.3 cm hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe is a simple cyst. An adjacent slightly enhancing 9mm hypodensity likely represents an adjacent hemangioma. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis. Tiny bilateral kidney hypodensities statistically likely represent cysts. The appendix is dilated to 7 mm with wall hyperenhancement and surrounding stranding.",
