        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis was supported by imaging findings, specifically the CT scan that showed a dilated, fluid-filled appendix measuring 12 mm in diameter with hyperenhancing walls and surrounding fat stranding, which are consistent with appendicitis. The patient had tenderness over McBurney's point, further supporting the diagnosis."
