        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulosis was supported by the finding of extensive diverticulosis seen on CT imaging, which was confirmed by the absence of complications such as bowel wall thickening or fat stranding. The patient's acute presentation of bright red blood per rectum and associated symptoms, along with imaging results, aligned with this diagnosis."
