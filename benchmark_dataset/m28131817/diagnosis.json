        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis was supported by the presence of bowel wall thickening involving the cecum and proximal ascending colon, pericolonic fat stranding, and a dilated appendix, indicating inflammatory changes related to diverticula. The absence of free air or pneumatosis further supports the diagnosis."
