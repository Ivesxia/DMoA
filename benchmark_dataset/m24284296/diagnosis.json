        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by CT imaging findings which showed a dilated appendix measuring up to 12 mm in diameter with a thickened wall and fluid filled, along with periappendiceal mesenteric stranding. The clinical presentation of periumbilical pain worsening in the right lower quadrant and associated symptoms further supported the diagnosis."
