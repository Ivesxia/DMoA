        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe left back and RUQ pain, mild nausea, and a history of gallstones. Imaging studies indicated the presence of gallstones, and elevated liver function tests supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. Previous episodes of similar pain and treatment for a UTI further suggest a recurrent issue related to gallstones."
