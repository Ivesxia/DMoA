            "findings": "A significant amount of inflammatory change is noted within the right lower quadrant ventral to the cecum. Inflamed hyperenhancing tubular structure consistent with the appendix extends out from the region of cecal thickening. Hyperenhancing appendiceal wall becomes inconspicuous in the expected region of the tip which becomes lost in inflammatory phlegmon. A 5 mm appendicolith is distal to the ruptured appendiceal tip within the inflammatory stranding. Secondary wall thickening and inflammatory change is present within the adjacent terminal ilium and jejunal loop. A small amount of simple fluid tracks along the right anterolateral pelvic peritoneal wall (2:65).",
