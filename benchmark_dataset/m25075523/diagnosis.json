    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cholecystitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain after eating, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An ultrasound showed gallstones in a minimally distended gallbladder without significant wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The symptoms and imaging findings suggest gallstone pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis."
