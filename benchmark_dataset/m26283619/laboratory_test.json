            "findings": "Dense linear opacifications noted in the lung bases, left greater than right, likely reflecting atelectasis. Heart size is normal. The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without discrete masses or lesions. The gallbladder is normal. The pancreas is atrophic. The bilateral kidneys contain multiple rounded hypodensities, consistent with simple cysts. No hydronephrosis or hydroureter identified. The small bowel is distended and fluid-filled. The appendix is dilated, with a maximal diameter of 1.1 cm, with hyperemic mucosa and surrounding inflammatory change. Fat stranding and phlegmonous changes suggest microperforation. No free air identified. Free fluid noted within the abdomen. Mild inflammation at the cecal tip. A large 1.5 cm diverticula is present within the sigmoid colon without associated inflammation. No lymphadenopathy identified. Atherosclerotic changes are present in the aorta without aneurysm or dissection. Fat containing inguinal hernia identified on the left. Multilevel degenerative change detected.",
