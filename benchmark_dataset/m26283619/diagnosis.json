        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute perforated appendicitis was supported by findings on the CT scan which showed a dilated appendix with hyperemic mucosa and surrounding inflammatory changes, indicating microperforation. Additionally, the history of left-sided abdominal pain extending to the right lower quadrant, tenderness in the RLQ, and associated clinical findings contributed to this diagnosis."
