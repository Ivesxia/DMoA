    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT abdomen findings demonstrated a dilated appendix measuring up to 8 mm in diameter with hyperemic walls and fluid filling, which is most compatible with acute appendicitis. Additionally, there were no signs of bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air, and other abdominal organs appeared unremarkable, supporting the diagnosis."
