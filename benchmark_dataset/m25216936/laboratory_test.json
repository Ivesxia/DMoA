Diverticulosis is present along the sigmoid colon with marked wall edema and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. A loculated area of hypodensity with peripheral enhancement measuring approximately 1.9 x 2.7 suggests intramural abscess. Additionally, multiple adjacent locules of extraluminal gas are present, the largest measuring 2 x 2.5 cm. A 20 x 14-mm collection of fluid adjacent to the inflammation does not show any thick wall or rim enhancement, but could represent a developing abscess.",
