Diverticulosis is present along the sigmoid colon with marked wall edema and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. A loculated area of hypodensity with peripheral enhancement measuring approximately 1.9 x 2.7 suggests intramural abscess. Multiple adjacent locules of extraluminal gas are present, the largest of which measures 2 x 2.5 cm. Foci of free intraperitoneal air seen scattered throughout the abdomen and below the diaphragm. Adjacent to this inflammation in the lower left pelvis is a 20 x 14-mm collection of fluid that could represent a developing abscess.",
