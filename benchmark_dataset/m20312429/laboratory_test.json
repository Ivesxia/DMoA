There is no definite evidence of perforation. Multiple hepatic hypodensities are too small to characterize but most likely cysts. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. There is dilation of the right renal pelvis and minimal blunting of the calyces which may be due to a ureteropelvic junction obstruction.",
