        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation of upper abdominal and back pain, along with imaging findings including a distended gallbladder, pericholecystic fluid, and elevated serum lipase levels. The CT findings of an enlarged pancreas and associated peripancreatic fluid further align with this diagnosis."
