Mild decrease in the subdiaphragmatic fluid collection with a peripheral enhancing irregular rim and locules of air consistent for an abscess. Multiple pseudocysts in the pancreas with one measuring 4.1 x 3.4 cm (previously 5.3 x 3.7 cm) and another measuring 2.5 x 2.1 cm (previously 2.7 x 2.1 cm).
