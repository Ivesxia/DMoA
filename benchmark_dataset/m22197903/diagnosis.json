        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of diverticulitis with colovesicular fistula was made based on the imaging findings of a diverticulum containing fecal material and gas, with evidence of a soft tissue tract extending from the sigmoid colon to the urinary bladder. Additionally, findings included mild perinephric stranding and gas in the bladder, which corroborate the diagnosis."
