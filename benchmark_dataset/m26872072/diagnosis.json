        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patientâ€™s symptoms of intractable nausea/vomiting and epigastric pain following the ingestion of scallops. Significant laboratory findings include a lipase level of 1600, indicative of pancreatitis, and imaging studies that showed multiple gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening. Additionally, the patient has a history of Crohn disease and abnormal liver/gallbladder findings on MR enterography, which guided further investigation."
