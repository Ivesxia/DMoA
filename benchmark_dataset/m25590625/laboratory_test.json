Gallbladder shows no stones or wall edema. The spleen is normal in size and appearance. The pancreas shows no masses or peripancreatic stranding. The adrenal glands are normal appearing bilaterally. The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically. Small and large intestines show no signs of obstruction. There is no lymphadenopathy, free air or free fluid. The appendix is dilated up to 9 mm, fluid filled, and with enhancing, hyperemic walls. In the distal appendiceal tip is a 8 mm x 8 mm appendicolith. Subtle periappendiceal haze is demonstrated.",
