        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant, along with CT findings showing a hyperemic appendix, thickened walls, and a round rim-enhancing fluid collection consistent with an abscess due to appendiceal rupture, supports the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. Additional findings of significant fat stranding and wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum were noted."
