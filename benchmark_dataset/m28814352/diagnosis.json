        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of gallbladder disease, including gradual onset of epigastric 'gnawing' pain, nausea, and vomiting. Given her history of gallstone pancreatitis and the review of her clinical history leading to discussions about elective cholecystectomy, the diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis is supported."
