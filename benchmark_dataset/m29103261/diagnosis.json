        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain following a fatty meal, her physical examination revealing tenderness in the epigastric region and RUQ, and imaging findings that revealed a stone in the bile duct. Additionally, the patient's lipase level was indicative of pancreatitis. Previous episodes of similar pain after fatty meals further supported the diagnosis."
