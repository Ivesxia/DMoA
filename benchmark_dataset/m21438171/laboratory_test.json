Few scattered arterially hyperenhancing foci are seen without correlate on additional sequences, likely transient hepatic intensity differences. No ascites.",
                "biliary": "Moderately dilated intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts as well as pancreatic duct which smoothly tapers towards the ampulla, consistent with ampullary stenosis. No enhancing mass. No choledocholithiasis. No peribiliary enhancement.",

Celiac axis, SMA, bilateral renal arteries, and accessory left renal artery are patent. Hepatic anatomy is conventional. Hepatic veins, main portal vein, SMV, and splenic vein are patent.",
