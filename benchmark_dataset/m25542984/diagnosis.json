        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain that started as periumbilical pain and later localizing to the RLQ, associated with nausea and a small amount of diarrhea. Key findings included RLQ tenderness with rebound upon exam, along with imaging results from a CT scan that indicated a dilated retrocecal appendix with hyperenhanced walls and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis."
