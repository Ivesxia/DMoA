The right portal vein is also patent with hepatopetal flow although the branches are suboptimally assessed. Appropriate arterial waveforms are seen in the main, right, and left hepatic arteries with resistive indices of (0.57, 0.62, 0.54), respectively. Appropriate flow seen in the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava."
