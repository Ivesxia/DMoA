        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric abdominal pain that worsened after eating, associated with nausea. Laboratory results showed elevated lipase at 170, which is indicative of pancreatitis. The physical exam revealed epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding, and ultrasound findings did not suggest any other acute abdominal processes."
