        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's admission was due to severe epigastric abdominal pain and vomiting, with a notable history of alcohol consumption and a previous less severe episode of pain. The absence of diarrhea, fever, and previous abdominal issues, along with the patient's medical history, pointed towards gallstone pancreatitis as the most likely diagnosis."
