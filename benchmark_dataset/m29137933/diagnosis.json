        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, which was exacerbated by a 'pop' sensation, indicating possible perforation. Imaging (CXR) suggested free air under the diaphragm. A CT scan showed free air in the abdomen, wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, and associated fat stranding, which are indicative of diverticulitis complications."
