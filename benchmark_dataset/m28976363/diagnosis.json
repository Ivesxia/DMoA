    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included abdominal pain primarily in the upper abdomen, radiating to the back, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea following the intake of a hamburger. The history of similar pain 6 months prior suggests a recurring issue possibly related to gallstones. The ERCP procedure revealed an impacted stone which supports the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
