There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is moderately distended with at least 2 gallstones in the gallbladder neck, measuring up to 1.3 cm. The gallbladder wall is mildly thickened. Hypodensity in the adjacent liver parenchyma is compatible with either focal fatty sparing or mild pericholecystic fluid. The patient was focally tender over the gallbladder.",
