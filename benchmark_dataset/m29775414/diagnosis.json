        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 36-hour history of suprapubic and right lower quadrant pain, with episodes of emesis. Initial attribution of symptoms to a ruptured ovarian cyst was reconsidered as symptoms did not resolve, prompting emergency department presentation. CT findings revealed appendicoliths within the appendix, with a top normal diameter, leading to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
