        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a two-day history of worsening nausea, vomiting, and diffuse abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The physical exam identified tenderness in the RLQ without rebound or guarding. An MRI of the abdomen revealed a mildly distended appendix with fluid in its lumen and equivocal wall thickening, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
