        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Gallstone Pancreatitis was supported by the patient's presentation with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as laboratory findings that showed significant elevation in AST and ALT levels, indicating liver involvement. Additionally, ultrasound findings reported small stones in the gallbladder, which can lead to pancreatitis. The patient's previous history of similar symptoms also reinforces the diagnosis."
