        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, alongside imaging findings from a CT abdomen and pelvis that showed an enlarged and fluid-filled appendix, with mild fat stranding around it. No other potential causes were identified, and there was no evidence of perforation."
