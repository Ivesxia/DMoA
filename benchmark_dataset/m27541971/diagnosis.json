        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis with microperforations was supported by CT findings of fascial plane thickening and minimal bowel wall thickening in the left lower quadrant at the level of the sigmoid colon, as well as the presence of tiny foci of air indicating microperforations. There were no drainable collections or pneumoperitoneum noted."
