        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient is a former alcoholic with a history of significant liver disease and presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain that is sharp and stabbing, worsened by movement and deep inspiration. On physical examination, there is tenderness in the RUQ along with a palpable mass suggestive of a distended gallbladder. The absence of fever, nausea, or vomiting and the patient's prior medical history suggest the diagnosis of pancreatitis following a surgical procedure (ERPC)."
