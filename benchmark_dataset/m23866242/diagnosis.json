        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of intermittent sharp right lower quadrant pain, which is colicky and exacerbated by movement, combined with the CT findings of a minimally dilated appendix, mild fat stranding, and fascial thickening, support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. There were no signs of appendicolith, extraluminal free air, or accompanying intra-abdominal free fluid, which further supports this diagnosis."
