        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain correlated with fatty meal consumption, and ultrasound findings showed gallbladder wall thickening and stones, along with tenderness in the RUQ. Despite normal liver function tests and white blood cell count, the clinical presentation supported a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, warranting a laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
