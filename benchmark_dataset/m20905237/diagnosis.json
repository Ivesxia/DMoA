        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the presence of a dilated fluid-filled appendix measuring up to 10 mm in diameter with hyperemic wall and extensive periappendiceal fat stranding, indicating inflammation. Additional findings included wall thickening of the cecum likely reactive in nature, and the absence of evidence for abscess formation or perforation."
