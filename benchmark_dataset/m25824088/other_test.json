Portions of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas demonstrate T1 hyperintensity on pre-contrast images with corresponding hypoenhancement, consistent with areas of necrosis. The pancreatic duct is not well seen due to diffuse edema. The gallbladder is mildly distended with multiple small stones. There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. Small bilateral pleural effusions were present, new since the prior recent CT.",
