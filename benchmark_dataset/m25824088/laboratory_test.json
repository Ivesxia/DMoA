Portions of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas demonstrate T1 hyperintensity with corresponding hypoenhancement, consistent with areas of necrosis. The pancreatic duct is not well seen due to diffuse edema. The gallbladder is mildly distended with multiple small stones. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver present, no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The portal, hepatic, superior mesenteric, and splenic veins are patent. Hepatic arteries are patent. Small cysts noted in the upper pole of the right kidney. Small bilateral pleural effusions present, new since the prior recent CT.",
