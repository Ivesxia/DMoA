            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "Multiple diverticula within the sigmoid colon, a 9 cm inflamed segment of the sigmoid colon with marked wall edema thickening, and pericolonic fat stranding. There was a decrease in size of the air and fluid collection just anterior to the sigmoid colon, now measuring 3 x 1.9 cm, previously 5 x 3 cm. Additionally, likely two small fluid collections within the wall of the sigmoid colon suggestive of intramural abscess. A small amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis.",
            "changes_over_time": "The air and fluid collection decreased in size, suggesting communication with the bowel and auto-decompression."
