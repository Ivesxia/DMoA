        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by imaging findings including multiple diverticula in the sigmoid colon, an inflamed segment of sigmoid colon, and the presence of air and fluid suggesting communication with the bowel. The decrease in size of the fluid collection indicated auto-decompression, which further supported the diagnosis."
