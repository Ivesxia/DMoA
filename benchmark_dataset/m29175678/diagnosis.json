        "final_diagnosis": "acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is supported by the presence of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, tenderness upon deep palpation in the RLQ, and imaging findings including fat stranding around the appendix and mild dilatation of the appendiceal tip. The CT scan shows no drainable fluid collection or free air, which helps rule out perforation. Additionally, the patient's history of symptoms, including episodes of melena and sharp RLQ pain, aligns with the clinical presentation of appendicitis."
