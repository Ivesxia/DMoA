Kidneys are normal without nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis. Small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aorta. The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and prostate are normal. No free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
