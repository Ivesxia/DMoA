        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by imaging findings indicating gallstones within the neck of the gallbladder, edema of the gallbladder wall, and a report of the patient's sharp, constant periumbilical pain. The absence of pericholecystic hyperemia and common bile duct dilation suggested that the condition was not in an advanced stage, but the gallbladder's abnormal appearance was consistent with acute cholecystitis."
