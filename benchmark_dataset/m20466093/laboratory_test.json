Gallbladder wall edema noted, but no pericholecystic hyperemia. The common bile duct measures 3 mm with no dilatation. The pancreas shows normal intensity except for a 4mm cyst in the pancreatic head. A heterogeneously T1 hyperintense lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney measures up to 2.2 cm, likely a hemorrhagic cyst.",
