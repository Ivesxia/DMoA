        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of marked gallbladder wall thickening (1.6 cm) and numerous gallstones on ultrasound, coupled with the patient's localized RUQ abdominal pain, led to the diagnosis of cholecystitis. The patient's history of recurrent RUQ pain and the surgical intervention (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) further support this diagnosis."
