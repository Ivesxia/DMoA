        "final_diagnosis": "Acute gangrenous appendicitis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with periumbilical abdominal pain that evolved into right lower quadrant pain accompanied by nausea and emesis. Imaging revealed a dilated appendix (up to 12 mm) with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, which supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The absence of free air or fluid and unremarkable findings in other abdominal organs further supported the diagnosis."
