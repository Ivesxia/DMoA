        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's severe abdominal pain, tenderness in the periumbilical and infraumbilical region, and the imaging findings indicating a prominent appendix. There was no evidence of peritonitis, free fluid, or air, and other intra-abdominal organs appeared unremarkable, helping to confirm the diagnosis."
