        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms consistent with acute appendicitis, including localized abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), multiple episodes of nausea and non-bilious emesis, anorexia, fevers, and chills. The CT abdomen and pelvis findings noted a borderline enlarged appendix (7 mm, mostly fluid-filled) with slightly hyperemic wall, and gas foci within the appendix, all suggestive of early appendicitis."
