        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of severe abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, along with imaging findings of multiple appendicoliths, a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant suggesting rupture, inflammatory fat stranding, and thickening of the terminal ileum. The absence of significant intraabdominal free air and the presence of a peritoneal abscess further confirmed this diagnosis."
