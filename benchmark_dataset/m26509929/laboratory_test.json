The liver otherwise demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. The appendix is dilated, measuring up to 1.5 cm in diameter, with internal hyperdensities, likely appendicolith(s). Periappendiceal fat stranding and a small amount of fluid is seen tracking along the fascia. No extraluminal gas or drainable fluid collection is seen. There is adjacent mild reactive thickening of the small bowel. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There are multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the left kidney, likely cysts. No evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis.",
