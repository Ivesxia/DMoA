        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset epigastric pain that radiated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), localized tenderness in RLQ, nausea, anorexia, chills, and fever. A CT scan revealed a dilated appendix measuring 1.5 cm with internal hyperdensities likely indicating appendicoliths, along with periappendiceal fat stranding and small amounts of fluid, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
