        "differential_diagnosis": "possible IPMN",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse intermittent infraumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Lab results indicated an elevated lipase level (250), supporting the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The context of the symptoms, including the vomiting and abdominal pain not related to meals, along with imaging findings that ruled out obstruction and other pathologies contributed to this final diagnosis."
