        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain primarily localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) after initial vague diffuse pain. The pain worsened with oral intake and movement, accompanied by anorexia and nausea. Imaging (CT scan) findings demonstrated wall thickening of the appendix measuring up to 14 mm, with associated inflammatory changes at the base of the cecum, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
