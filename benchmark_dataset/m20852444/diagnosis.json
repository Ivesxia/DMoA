        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's report of sharp, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, and imaging results showing a fluid-filled and markedly dilated appendix measuring 13 mm in diameter. The absence of free fluid and normal bowel appearances reinforced this diagnosis."
