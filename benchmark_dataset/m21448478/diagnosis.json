        "final_diagnosis": "Complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), which was heme occult positive on exam. Imaging studies (CT abdomen and pelvis) indicated a partially air-filled cavity near the sigmoid colon with surrounding fat stranding, suggestive of mild residual inflammatory changes indicative of diverticulitis. Additionally, the patient's elevated white blood cell count and other signs supported the diagnosis."
