            "findings": "The tip of a new right PICC line projects over the upper right atrium, approximately 2.5 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, new as well as subjacent atelectasis. There is a well-defined linear interface projecting over the left lung apex although lung markings are seen peripheral to it and this may reflect a skin fold as opposed to a pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular joint are noted.",
