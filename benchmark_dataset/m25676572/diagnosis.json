        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patient's presentation of sharp diffuse abdominal pain, similar to a previous episode of passing a gallstone, along with the ultrasound findings showing multiple mobile stones in the gallbladder. The pain pattern, along with the patient's history, aligns with galstone-induced pancreatic inflammation."
