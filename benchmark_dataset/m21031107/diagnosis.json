        "final_diagnosis": "Acute perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute perforated appendicitis was supported by imaging findings of a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with mucosal hyperenhancement and periappendiceal edema. Clinical presentation included abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, alongside physical examination findings of tenderness in the lower abdomen. The absence of free air and normal findings in other abdominal organs contributed to the final diagnosis."
