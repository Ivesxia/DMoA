        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, chills, and subjective fevers along with evidence of extensive fat stranding and multiple locules of free air in the right iliac fossa, suggesting perforation. A loculated fluid collection in the same area, alongside findings of wall thickening of the lower ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum, supported the diagnosis."
