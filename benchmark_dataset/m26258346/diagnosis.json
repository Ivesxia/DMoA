        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain that started suddenly, accompanied by nausea and subjective fevers. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric and lower quadrants, with positive rebound tenderness and a positive Psoas sign. A CT scan of the pelvis confirmed a dilated appendix measuring 11 mm with hyperemic wall and surrounding stranding, indicative of acute appendicitis, while ruling out perforation or abscess formation."
