        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and nausea after a cookie tasting event. Previously performed imaging, including an ultrasound that showed gallstones and pericholecystic fluid, supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Additionally, a low ejection fraction from a HIDA scan suggested biliary dyskinesia, which was consistent with her symptoms."
