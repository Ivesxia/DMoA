            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "Bilateral pleural effusions appear increased since ___. Minimal compressive atelectasis is noted bilaterally. Large peripancreatic partially walled off fluid collection measures at largest dimension in axial plane 11.6 x 6.3 cm with peripheral rim enhancement. Previously noted stones within the pancreas are no longer seen. Appearance of the pancreas is heterogeneous given the interdigitation of the fluid within the parenchyma. The 2 peripheral areas of hypodensity in the body and neck of the pancreas could represent fluid interdigitating through the parenchyma or early necrosis. A single area of free air in the anterior mesentery is noted without evidence of viscus perforation.",
            "changes_over_time": "The gallbladder is surgically absent since last CT. Previously noted stones within the pancreas are no longer seen."
