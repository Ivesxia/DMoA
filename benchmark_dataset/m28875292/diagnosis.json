        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, nausea, and fever. An ultrasound showed a collection in the RLQ, suspicious for perforated appendicitis, but further evaluation with a CT scan indicated cecal diverticulosis with thickened cecal wall and surrounding fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis."
