        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of cholelithiasis, epigastric pain following a fatty meal, darker urine (suggesting possible biliary obstruction), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) indicate gallstone pancreatitis. Imaging showed stone-filled gallbladder without acute cholecystitis, further supporting the diagnosis."
