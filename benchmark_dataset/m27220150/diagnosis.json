        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the CT findings, which showed a dilated appendix measuring up to 10 mm with mural hyperenhancement, periappendiceal fat stranding, and adjacent fascial thickening, all consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. There were no findings suggestive of complications such as perforation or abscess formation."
