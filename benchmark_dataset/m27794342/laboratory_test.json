There is periappendiceal stranding, with a prominent adjacent 8-mm lymph node. No drainable fluid collection or free air is seen within the pelvis. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, left kidney, both ureters appear normal. Tiny 3 mm hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney is too small to accurately characterize but likely represents a tiny cyst.",
