        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of sudden onset right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, localized tenderness on examination, and imaging findings showing dilation of the appendix to 14 mm, an appendicolith, and periappendiceal stranding. The absence of other significant abdominal abnormalities on CT and the lack of fever further corroborated the diagnosis."
