        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by CT findings showing a dilated appendix measuring 8-9 mm, with wall irregularity and fluid-filled appearance, along with the patient's history of vague abdominal pain worsening over 24 hours. No other abdominal pathologies were identified that could explain the symptoms."
