        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation including fever with chills, severe headache, and nausea warranted investigation. Prior admissions for fever of unknown origin led to multiple tests, including a CT scan that indicated stranding around the transplanted kidney, raising suspicion of rejection or infection. No definitive infectious source was identified despite extensive workup, including cultures and imaging, and she had a history of E. coli bacteremia. Ultimately, cholecystitis was diagnosed, necessitating an open cholecystectomy."
