            "findings": "The liver parenchyma demonstrates homogeneous normal signal intensity. A 5 mm foci of arterial hyper enhancement is seen in segment 6 but has no correlate on later phases, likely representing a transient hepatic intensity difference. No suspicious focal lesions. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No evidence of stones. Some fat stranding and a 1.3 x 1.0 cm pocket of fluid is seen in the gallbladder fossa, likely related to the recent surgery. The pancreas demonstrates normal signal intensity without suspicious focal lesions. No pancreatic ductal dilatation. The spleen is normal in size without evidence of focal lesions. The adrenals are normal in size and shape. No suspicious renal lesions or hydronephrosis; a tiny simple cyst is seen in the interpolar region of the left kidney. The gastrointestinal tract is unremarkable with normal caliber without wall thickening or abnormal enhancement. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Small vertebral body hemangiomas in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.",
