        "final_diagnosis": "acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which were consistent with a prior history of similar episodes and known gallbladder polyp. The persistence of pain post-ingestion of tea and presentation to the emergency department, along with the past medical history of hyperlipidemia, likely contributed to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
