    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, the presence of a large dilated appendix measuring 1.6 cm on CT, and adjacent fat stranding. Additionally, the CT revealed an appendicolith and multiple enhancing periappendiceal nodes, which are compatible with reactive adenopathy. There was no evidence of free air, abscess, or other significant findings that could suggest an alternative diagnosis."
