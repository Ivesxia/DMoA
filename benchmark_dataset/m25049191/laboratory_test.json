No intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Smooth appearance of the CHD and CBD, without choledocholithiasis or evident stricture. Small layering gallstones are present. Mural gallbladder thickening of nondistended gallbladder is noted. There is peripancreatic fat stranding and thickening of the left anterior pararenal fascia, with enlargement of the pancreatic tail and body, compatible with known pancreatitis. No acute necrotic collection. There is an apparent linear 6 mm filling defect within the main pancreatic duct within the body, visualized on 2D and 3D MRCP sequences, without upstream or downstream ductal dilatation. Pancreatic inflammatory changes appear to be upstream to the defect.",
