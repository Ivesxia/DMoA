        "final_diagnosis": "Acute gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain radiating to the umbilical area and was experiencing nausea and vomiting. Imaging findings revealed small layering gallstones, mural thickening of the gallbladder, and peripancreatic fat stranding, which are indicative of pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient's history of similar attacks and recent diagnosis of h. pylori gastritis were ruled out as primary causes of her current symptoms."
