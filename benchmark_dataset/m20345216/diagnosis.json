        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of abdominal pain that began periumbilically and migrated to the right lower quadrant, associated with tenderness on examination, particularly in the right lower quadrant (TTP). Ultrasound findings indicated a noncompressible tubular structure consistent with the appendix, measuring 1.3 cm, containing heterogeneous debris, without significant surrounding hyperemia or fluid collection, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
