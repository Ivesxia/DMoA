        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right upper quadrant pain after a fatty meal, the history of similar biliary colic episodes, and the decision for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No evidence of fever, jaundice, or other complications was noted, suggesting an acute process related to the gallbladder."
