Small left pleural effusion, slightly decreased in volume when compared to the study performed previously and unchanged from later examination. Mild right basilar atelectasis. Abdomen: Patient is status-post transhepatic ultrasound-guided placement of tube, which is in satisfactory position. There is no significant fat stranding surrounding the gallbladder. No high-density hematoma or fluid collection along the tract of the new percutaneous catheter. Patient is status-post vertical sleeve gastrectomy. Previously described small focal dehiscence in the fundal suture is not well visualized on this non-contrast scan. Residual air and fluid containing collection which measures approximately 3.1 x 7.4 cm, previously 3.4 x 7.7 cm. A pigtail catheter remains within this collection. There are no new fluid collections within the upper abdomen. No evidence of increasing free intra-abdominal fluid. Previously described liver cysts are unchanged. No new solid organ findings.",
