The distal appendix is thickened and discontinuous, with punctate adjacent foci of air suggestive of perforation. There is regional peritonitis, phlegmonous changes, and reactive serosal inflammation of the adjacent sigmoid colon. The right gonadal vein appears asymmetrically enlarged and hypodense relative to the left, suggestive of thrombosis.",
