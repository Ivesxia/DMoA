            "findings": "The bases of the lungs are clear. The visualized heart is normal in size and without pericardial effusion. The liver demonstrates a 1.1 x 1.0 cm of focal fat deposition within the anterior right hepatic lobe adjacent to the falciform ligament. The portal venous system is patent. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally without evidence of hydronephrosis or solid renal mass. The stomach, duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal in caliber without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. The distal appendix is thickened and discontinuous, with punctate adjacent foci of air suggestive of perforation. In addition, there is regional peritonitis, phlegmonous changes, and reactive serosal inflammation of the adjacent sigmoid colon. No drainable fluid collection is noted. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber throughout. The celiac artery and SMA are patent. The right gonadal vein appears asymmetrically enlarged and hypodense relative to the left, suggestive of thrombosis. The urinary bladder is grossly unremarkable in appearance. No osseous destructive lesions concerning for malignancy are detected.",
