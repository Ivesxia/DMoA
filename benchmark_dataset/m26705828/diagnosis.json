        "final_diagnosis": "pancreatitis s/p ERCP, transaminitis of unclear etiology",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pancreatitis was suggested by the patient's presentation of RUQ pain, jaundice, light-colored stools, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT 325, AST 109, AP 272). Additionally, imaging studies showed significant findings such as mild pancreatic duct dilatation and possibly connected cysts indicative of IPMN. The absence of biliary dilatation and the unclear etiology of transaminitis further supported the diagnosis, alongside recent procedures like ERCP which were performed to address these issues."
