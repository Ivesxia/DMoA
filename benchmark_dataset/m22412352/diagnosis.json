        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patient's history of severe epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, vomiting, and imaging findings showing a distended gallbladder with wall thickening, mural edema, and numerous calcified gallstones. The absence of significant findings in the pancreas does not preclude the diagnosis of pancreatitis linked to gallstones."
