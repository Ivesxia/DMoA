            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "Limited views of the lung bases demonstrate mild right-sided dependent atelectasis. There is no focal nodule or opacity. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. There is a small hiatal hernia. The liver is normal without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is layering hyperdense material in the gallbladder which likely represents a combination of stone and sludge without secondary signs to suggest cholecystitis. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen. The stomach, small and large bowel are unremarkable with the exception of the appendix which is fluid filled, enlarged with marked mucosal hyperenhancement and thickening with periappendiceal fat stranding. The appendix measures 12 mm. There is no surrounding free air or fluid collection. There is some mucosal irregularity of the posterior wall of the appendix. There are some nonenlarged but notable regional lymph nodes. Cecal wall thickness is normal. CT of the pelvis shows scattered sigmoid diverticula. The bladder, uterus and rectum are unremarkable. In the adnexa, there are some enlarged left pelvic venous structures. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.",
