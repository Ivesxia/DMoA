        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis is supported by the CT findings which show focal wall thickening and pericolonic inflammatory change around the upper sigmoid colon, consistent with diverticulitis, along with evidence of a local microperforation indicated by the presence of a small hypodense focus containing gas. The clinical presentation includes significant lower abdominal pain without accompanying symptoms like fever or changes in bowel habits."
