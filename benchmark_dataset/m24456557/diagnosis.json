        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1 day history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant with voluntary guarding. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed a prominent appendix measuring approximately 8 mm, with air in the tip and slight thickening, which are concerning for early appendicitis. No other abdominal abnormalities were noted."
