        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden onset periumbilical abdominal pain that evolved into right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, along with physical examination findings of tenderness and voluntary guarding in the RLQ. Imaging studies (CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast) revealed a retrocecal appendix that was fluid-filled and dilated, with surrounding inflammatory changes including wall thickening and fat stranding."
