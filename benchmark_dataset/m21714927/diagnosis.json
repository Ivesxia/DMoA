        "final_diagnosis": "Complicated diverticulitis s/p low anterior resection/left colectomy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history suggestive of severe diverticulitis with fluid collections and inflammatory changes indicative of a contained perforation. A CT scan showed no mass lesions in the liver or signs of carcinomatosis, and the CEA elevation was likely due to chronic smoking and sigmoid inflammation. The decision for colectomy was based on her history and the findings from imaging, along with the patient's condition."
