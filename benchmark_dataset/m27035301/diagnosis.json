        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made based on the patient's history of abdominal pain, ultrasound findings showing multiple small stones within the gallbladder, and associated biliary duct dilation. The absence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, along with the patient's overall stable condition, supported the diagnosis."
