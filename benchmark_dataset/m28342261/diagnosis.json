        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, specifically in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and chills. He has a known history of gallstones, and the ultrasound findings revealed a 2.5 cm gallbladder stone. The gallbladder was distended, indicating a possible obstruction, consistent with acute cholecystitis."
