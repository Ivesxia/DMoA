        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and RUQ discomfort, elevated lipase levels (9865), and imaging findings consistent with cholelithiasis and pancreatic edema. The absence of intrahepatic duct dilatation and no evidence of choledocholithiasis support the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
