The appendix is thickened and dilated to 10 mm, with extensive adjacent periappendiceal right lower quadrant fat stranding. There appears to be a defect in the distal appendiceal tip, which may represent perforation. There is a small amount of adjacent free fluid, without a discrete drainable fluid collection. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Multiple other adjacent loops of small bowel are thickened.",
