        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, feverish feeling, and physical examination findings of rebound tenderness and positive Rovsing's and obturator signs. The CT abdomen confirmed the presence of a hyperemic and enlarged retrocecal appendix with associated fluid, which indicates inflammation without evidence of abscess or perforation."
