        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated gangrenous cholecystitis was based on the patient's clinical presentation, including abdominal pain, fever, chills, and the CT findings showing the gallbladder wall interruption and surrounding inflammation. The presence of a stone in the gallbladder neck and a walled-off collection adjacent to the gallbladder further supported this diagnosis."
