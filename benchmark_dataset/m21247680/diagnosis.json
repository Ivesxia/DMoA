        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden-onset epigastric and left upper quadrant pain following a meal, which persisted and was associated with nausea and bilious vomiting. Elevated lipase level (1000) indicated pancreatitis. Further investigations excluded hepatobiliary causes. Positive blood cultures for GNRs indicated bacteremia, which was considered during evaluation. The patient's clinical history of CAD and other comorbidities contributed to the diagnostic complexity."
