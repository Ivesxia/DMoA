        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant and back pain, nausea, and a history of gallstones. The pain was constant and bandlike, which, in conjunction with the absence of fever and the recent intake of food without an increase in pain, supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. Additional findings such as abdominal tenderness in the RUQ also contributed to this diagnosis."
