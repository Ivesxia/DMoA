            "findings": "Evaluation of midline structures is limited by poor acoustic windows secondary to overlying bowel gas. The pancreas is not well visualized. Liver does not demonstrate focal lesions or textural abnormality. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Common bile duct measures 7 mm. Gallbladder does not appear overtly distended but does demonstrate mild wall thickening and multiple stones. Linear hypodensities within the liver adjacent to the gallbladder likely represents areas of focal fatty sparing. Trace amount of free fluid is seen along the liver edge. Sonographic Murphy's sign is negative. The spleen is markedly enlarged measuring 21 cm.",
