The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, small bowel, colon, rectum, prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and terminal ureters are normal. The appendix is enlarged and dilated measuring 1.2 cm with surrounding stranding and high-density objects consistent with appendicoliths. There is a tiny amount of fluid adjacent to the appendix but no evidence of abscess or free air. The SMV and IMV are patent, the aorta is normal in caliber. No acute bony abnormality.",
