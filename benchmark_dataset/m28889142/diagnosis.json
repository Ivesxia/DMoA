        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain following the consumption of nachos, along with severe epigastric pain that radiated to the RUQ, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound performed at an outside hospital showed evidence of gallstones, leading to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. No history of similar symptoms was reported, and the physical examination indicated tenderness in the RUQ."
