        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain, fever, and chills, which raised concern for an acute abdominal condition. Clinical examination revealed minimal tenderness in the RLQ without peritoneal signs, but significant past medical history suggested an increased risk for complications. Imaging and clinical findings supported the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis, leading to the placement of phlegmon."
