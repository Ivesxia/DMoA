            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "The appendix contains an appendicolith and remains dilated measuring up to 1.5 cm with surrounding fat stranding. There is a small to moderate volume of free fluid tracking along the right pericolic gutter and into the pelvis which has slightly increased in amount since prior imaging. A fluid collection in the anterior abdominal wall with possible rim enhancement measures 2.9 x 1.4 x 3.6 cm, and is new since the prior CT.",
            "changes_over_time": "Compared to the prior CT, there is relatively decreased small bowel dilation which may indicate resolving/partial obstruction. A small fluid containing paraumbilical hernia measures 3.6 cm and has a neck measuring 1.6 cm which is unchanged since the prior CT."
