        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with constant right lower quadrant pain, which is a classic symptom of acute appendicitis. The CT abdomen and pelvis showed an unremarkable appendix, but the clinical presentation strongly suggested appendicitis leading to a laparoscopic appendectomy."
