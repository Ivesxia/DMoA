        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. _____ presented with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and diaphoresis. Initial labs showed transaminitis and an elevated lipase. An abdominal ultrasound revealed steatosis and nonmobile echogenic foci in the gallbladder, without obstruction. These findings, along with the patient's symptom history and prior episodes, supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
