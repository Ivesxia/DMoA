            "findings": "Bibasilar atelectasis. The gallbladder has surrounding wall edema. The appendix is mildly enlarged measuring 7 mm, but there is no associated surrounding inflammation or mural hyperemia to suggest acute appendicitis. A 2.8 x 2.3 cm fat-containing lesion in the right adnexa with soft tissue nodule is most consistent with a dermoid.",
