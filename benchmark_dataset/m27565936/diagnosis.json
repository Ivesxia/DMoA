        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. The CT abdomen and pelvis revealed dilatation of a fluid-filled appendix with an appendicolith and periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
