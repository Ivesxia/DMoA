        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 2 days of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which localized over the past day and was described as sharp and crampy. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ, slight right flank tenderness, and equivocal psoas/obturator signs. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a dilated retrocecal appendix measuring up to 13 mm with hyperemia and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
