            "findings": "New opacification of the right lung base silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border without significant associated volume loss suggesting a moderate right pleural effusion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle compatible with a small left pleural effusion. Streaky opacification of the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are compatible with cholecystectomy.",
