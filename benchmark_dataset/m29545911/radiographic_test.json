A 0.8 x 0.7 cm accessory spleen is noted. A 2 mm nonobstructing stone is seen within the left lower pole collecting system. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys are unremarkable except for mild fat stranding at the cecal base. Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine and evidence of old healed anterior corner fractures are present.",
