        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate oral intake after several weeks of low-grade abdominal discomfort. The imaging findings indicated mild dilation of the distal colon and multiple air-fluid levels, which were concerning for postoperative ileus. The clinical presentation and imaging findings, along with the recent history of surgery, supported the diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis."
