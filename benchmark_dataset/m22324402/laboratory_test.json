            "findings": "There is a 6 x 5-mm pulmonary nodule involving right upper lobe. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Heart is mildly enlarged without pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. Moderate hiatal hernia is present with fluid-filled esophagus. The liver enhances homogeneously without discrete hepatic lesions. Mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is noted. Gallbladder appears distended with gallbladder wall edema. No gallstones are seen within its lumen. The common bile duct is markedly dilated measuring up to 14 mm in maximum diameter. The pancreas enhances homogeneously without peripancreatic fat stranding or fluid collection. The pancreatic duct is minimally prominent. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses.",
