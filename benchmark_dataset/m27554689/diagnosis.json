        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of cholecystitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of RUQ abdominal pain, confirmed by imaging showing gallbladder wall thickening and air within the gallbladder wall, as well as the presence of intraluminal stones. The repeat CT indicated increased gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, which are indicative of cholecystitis."
