        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a two-day history of constant right upper quadrant pain, along with imaging findings of multiple gallstones, thickening of the gallbladder wall, and an inability of some stones at the gallbladder neck to appear mobile, indicating inflammation. These findings, combined with the patient's symptoms and history of prior similar episodes, supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
