        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patientâ€™s presentation of severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, the presence of a distended gallbladder with a thickened wall on ultrasound, and the finding of stones in the gallbladder. Additional clinical findings included focal tenderness in the RUQ and a palpable mass that was likely the gallbladder."
