        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the presence of a markedly distended gallbladder with numerous gallstones and an obstructing stone in the gallbladder neck, leading to significant distension and mild compression of the biliary tree. Evidence of fat stranding and trace gallbladder wall edema further supported this diagnosis."
