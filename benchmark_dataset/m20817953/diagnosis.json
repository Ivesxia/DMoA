        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by the patient's history of diverticulosis, symptoms of constipation, intermittent left lower quadrant abdominal pain resolving with defecation, and CT findings showing significant inflammation in the distal sigmoid colon with associated thickening and surrounding fat stranding without evidence of abscess. The presence of large stool burden in the colon further corroborated the diagnosis."
