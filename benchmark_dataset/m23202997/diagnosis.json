        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis with abscess formation was supported by the patient's presentation of consistent right-side abdominal pain, episodes of emesis, and physical examination findings of tenderness in the right lower quadrant. The imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis) revealed a periappendiceal abscess with adjacent fatty stranding, significantly increased in size, confirming the diagnosis."
