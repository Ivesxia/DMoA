Lack of circumferential mural enhancement of the posterior lateral appendiceal wall likely reflective of gangrenous appendicitis. Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. No evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. Liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, bladder, and adrenal glands appear normal. No abnormal lymphadenopathy or vascular disease noted.",
