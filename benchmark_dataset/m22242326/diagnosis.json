        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by a one day history of right lower quadrant pain that worsened, associated with nausea and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a dilated and fluid-filled appendix measuring up to 13 mm with adjacent free fluid, indicative of appendicitis. There was no evidence of perforation or alternative gastrointestinal abnormalities."
