        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening abdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with nausea and anorexia. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged and hyperemic appendix, and there was no evidence of perforation or other complications. Previous tests were negative for gallstones and other abdominal pathology, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
