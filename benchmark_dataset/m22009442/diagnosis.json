        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged and hyperemic appendix measuring up to 9 mm with minimal adjacent fat stranding, consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The clinical presentation included abdominal pain that started as mild epigastric pain shifting to the right lower quadrant, which is typical for appendicitis. There were no significant indicators of alternative diagnoses like perforation, obstruction, or other gastrointestinal issues."
