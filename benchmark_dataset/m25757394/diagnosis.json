        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of acute onset right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, nausea, and a physical examination showing tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, along with imaging findings of a fluid-filled and dilated appendix, supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The CT scan indicated minimal periappendiceal fat haziness without any evidence of perforation."
