        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of gradual onset of abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), the physical examination which noted tenderness in the RLQ with focal rebound and a positive psoas sign, as well as imaging findings from the CT scan that revealed a fluid-filled, distended appendix measuring up to 13 mm with surrounding inflammation and a likely appendicolith."
