        "final_diagnosis": "acute pancreatitis presumably from azathioprine",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is supported by elevated lipase levels (1219) and imaging findings showing an enlarged and edematous pancreas with adjacent fat stranding. The presentation of acute abdominal pain radiating to the back further supports this diagnosis."
