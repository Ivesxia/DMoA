        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. ___ presented with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with fevers/chills, which persisted after eating. His history of gallstones and previous episodes of LFT abnormalities along with recent acute symptoms were indicative of acute cholecystitis. Recommendations for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy also support this diagnosis, correlating with the patient's symptoms and history."
