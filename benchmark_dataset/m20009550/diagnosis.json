        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and emesis, and findings including nausea relief with antiemetics and abdominal pain relief with opioids. Initial imaging (CT abdomen) was significant for a small hiatal hernia and no other notable abnormalities, leading to concerns of pancreatitis. The evaluation during ERCP identified pancreatic divisum without strictures, contributing to the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
