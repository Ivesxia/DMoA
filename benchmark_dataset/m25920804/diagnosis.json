        "final_diagnosis": "Uncomplicated Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with diverticulitis. The absence of overt diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), or melena also supports this diagnosis. Additional historical context includes the patient's complex medical history, including ESRD on hemodialysis and recent infection history, which were considered in the assessment."
