        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain that migrated, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast indicated a dilated appendix measuring 13 mm with mucosal hyperenhancement, surrounding fat stranding, and thickening of adjacent fascia, which are consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of appendiceal rupture or appendicolith."
