        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which initially started as periumbilical and suprapubic pain that shifted to the right lower quadrant. The ultrasound findings showed a tubular, blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant with a maximal diameter of 6 mm and some adjacent free fluid, which is consistent with acute appendicitis."
