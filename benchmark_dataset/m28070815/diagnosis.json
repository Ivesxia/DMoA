        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a fluid-filled and dilated appendix measuring 1.1 cm, with wall thickening and associated stranding of the surrounding mesentery, along with the presence of an appendicolith. These findings are compatible with acute appendicitis."
