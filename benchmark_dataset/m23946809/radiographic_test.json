The wall appears discontinuous in several areas thus suspicious for perforation. At least 2 hypointense rounded structures within the appendix presumably reflecting appendicoliths. Small amount of free fluid seen within the right lower quadrant. Distension of the small bowel up to 3.4 cm and large bowel up to 7.3 cm. Single intrauterine pregnancy. No suspicious adnexal lesion. No adenopathy. Aorta and IVC normal caliber. No suspicious osseous lesion.",
