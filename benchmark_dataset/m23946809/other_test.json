The wall appears discontinuous in several areas thus suspicious for perforation. At least 2 hypointense rounded structures in the appendix presumably reflecting appendicoliths. A small amount of free fluid within the right lower quadrant. Distension of the small bowel measuring up to 3.4 cm and large bowel measuring up to 7.3 cm.",
