Within this inflammation is a dilated tubular structure measuring up to 9 mm, consistent with an inflamed appendix. The wall appears discontinuous in several areas thus suspicious for perforation. Within the appendix are at least 2 hypointense rounded structures presumably reflecting appendicoliths. A small amount of free fluid is also seen within the right lower quadrant. Distension of the small bowel measuring up to 3.4 cm with distension of the large bowel measuring up to 7.3 cm.",
