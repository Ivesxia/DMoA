No significant drop of signal on out-of-phase imaging to suggest steatosis. No focal liver lesions are seen. No ascites. Biliary: There is cholelithiasis. No MR evidence of acute cholecystitis. No intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. No evidence of choledocholithiasis. Pancreas: The pancreas is normal in morphology and signal intensity. There are no focal pancreatic lesions. No pancreatic duct dilation. Spleen: The spleen is normal in size. Note is made of a small accessory spleen. Adrenal Glands: The right and left adrenal glands are unremarkable. Kidneys: The kidneys are symmetric in size. No focal renal lesion is seen. Gastrointestinal Tract: There is no hiatal hernia. Views of the small and large bowel are unremarkable. Lymph Nodes: There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy. Vasculature: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. Portal vein is patent. Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: There is no suspicious bony lesion. Note is made of asymmetric atrophy of the right greater than left body wall musculature.",
