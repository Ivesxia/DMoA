        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with microperforation is supported by the CT findings of a segment of thickened sigmoid colon with moderate adjacent stranding and fluid in the left lower quadrant, along with scattered diverticula and small foci of extraluminal gas. This aligns with the patient's acute abdominal pain and symptoms."
