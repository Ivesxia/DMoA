        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was supported by the patient's presenting symptoms of epigastric pain radiating to the back, exacerbated by food, along with elevated lipase and amylase levels. Additionally, the patient's history of significant abdominal pain over 10 days and the findings from the CT scan indicating a large subcapsular hematoma contributed to this diagnosis."
