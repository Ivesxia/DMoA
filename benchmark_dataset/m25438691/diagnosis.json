        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which worsened with movement and straining. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ without guarding or rebound tenderness. CT imaging showed a hyperemic and dilated appendix with a diameter of 0.9 cm, a punctate appendicolith, and mild periappendiceal fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
