        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with characteristic symptoms of lower periumbilical abdominal pain that intensified, along with nausea, vomiting, and decreased urine output. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the lower abdomen but no signs of rebound or guarding, which is consistent with acute appendicitis. Diagnostic ultrasound confirmed the presence of a right lower quadrant abscess and a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made, leading to a laparoscopic appendectomy."
