Two adjacent thinly septated cysts are seen in the right lobe measuring at most 1.8 cm. Common bile duct is nondilated, measuring 6 cm. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. Numerous gallstones are seen in the gallbladder neck with wall thickening, mural edema, hyperemia and positive sonographic findings. The pancreas is poorly assessed due to overlying bowel gas. The aorta is normal in caliber throughout its visualized course but the distal aorta is obscured by overlying bowel gas. The imaged IVC is unremarkable. The kidneys are without hydronephrosis or stone bilaterally with the right kidney measuring 11.3 cm and the left kidney measuring 11.0 cm. A 5.5 cm left upper pole renal cyst is noted.
