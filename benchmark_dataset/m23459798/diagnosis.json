        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain that progressively worsened, accompanied by high fever, nausea, and localized tenderness in the suprapubic and periumbilical regions with a palpable mass. These findings, alongside the lack of improvement with antibiotic treatment for a presumed UTI, supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis."
