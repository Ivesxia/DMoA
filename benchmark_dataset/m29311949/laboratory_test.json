The gray-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is no CT evidence of acute ischemic infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or space-occupying lesion. Periventricular confluent low attenuation is consistent with sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. The cystic lesion involving the pineal gland with peripheral calcification is unchanged since ___ and likely represents a simple cyst.",
