The gray-white matter differentiation is well preserved. No CT evidence of acute ischemic infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or space-occupying lesion. Periventricular confluent low attenuation is consistent with sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. Cystic lesion involving the pineal gland with peripheral calcification is unchanged since previous imaging, likely representing a simple cyst.",
