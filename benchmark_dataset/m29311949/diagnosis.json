    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with RUQ abdominal pain after a fatty meal, consistent with acute cholecystitis. Additionally, she has a history of biliary colic and cholelithiasis, further supporting the diagnosis. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RUQ and mild abdominal distension. The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding suggests that the pain is likely due to gallbladder inflammation rather than an alternative acute abdominal condition."
