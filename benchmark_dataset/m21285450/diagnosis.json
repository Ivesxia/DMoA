        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis, post-ERCP",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain following an ERCP procedure. Key lab findings included elevated lipase levels (2463), which indicated acute pancreatitis. The abdominal pain was sharp and epigastric, supporting the diagnosis. The absence of fever and other significant complications on EKG and imaging further corroborated the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis post-ERCP."
