        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric/subxiphoid pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Lab results showed elevated lipase, which indicates pancreatitis. The ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed a normal pancreas and gallbladder, helping to rule out gallstone-related pancreatitis. The clinical presentation and lab findings supported the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
