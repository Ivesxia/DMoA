        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with constant, sharp left lower quadrant abdominal pain, which was exacerbated by defecation and associated with changes in stool pattern. Laboratory results showed an elevated lipase level, indicative of pancreatitis. The absence of gallstones or a history of heavy alcohol use was noted, but other signs supported the diagnosis."
