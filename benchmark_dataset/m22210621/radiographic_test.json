The pancreas is normal in size, without evidence of mass lesions. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of stones or hydronephrosis. The visualized small bowels appear unremarkable. There is no free fluid or free air. The visualized appendix measures 9 mm with thickened enhancing walls and periappendiceal stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. There is mild hyperemia of the wall of the adjacent cecum. There is no evidence of perforation of the appendix or local fluid collections. Enlarged right ileocolic lymph nodes are noted, which are most likely reactive.
