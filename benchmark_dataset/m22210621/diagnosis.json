        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain that progressed over three days, with CT findings showing a thickened appendix with periappendiceal stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. The absence of free air and local fluid collections suggested no active perforation, although the diagnosis indicated gangrenous appendicitis with perforation."
