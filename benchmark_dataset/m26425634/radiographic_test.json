The liver is hyperemic adjacent to the gallbladder fossa but otherwise normal. Pneumobilia is observed, which is slightly increased from prior, confirming two CBD stents are patent. The previously identified posterior pararenal fluid collection has nearly completely resolved, with mild residual thickening and stranding of the paraspinal musculature posterior to the right kidney. Other abdominal structures are unremarkable.",
