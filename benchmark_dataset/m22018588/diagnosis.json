        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset abdominal pain, which was sharp and diffuse, worsening with movement and abdominal pressure. Additionally, there were reports of loose bowel movements and non-bilious emesis. Improvement of pain with Tylenol and the clinical presentation were suggestive of acute appendicitis, ultimately leading to surgical intervention via laparoscopic appendectomy."
