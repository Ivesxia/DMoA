        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, emesis, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis. The presence of dense material at the base of the appendix may indicate an appendicolith."
