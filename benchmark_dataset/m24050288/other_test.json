No gallstones are seen. Mild central intrahepatic duct dilatation. The liver is normal in contour with a small non-enhancing lesion in segment VII consistent with a hamartoma measuring 6 mm. There are geographic areas of relative hypoperfusion anteriorly in segment IVb, likely reflecting perfusional abnormalities. No concerning liver lesions are seen. The pancreas is normal in signal intensity with incidental pancreas divisum noted.",
