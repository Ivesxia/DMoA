        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis versus malignancy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with persistent right lower quadrant pain, associated with sweats and chills, and the MRI revealed a significant lesion with thickened, irregular, and enhancing periphery near the expected location of the appendix, suggestive of a possible perforated appendicitis or malignancy. The lack of identification of a discrete appendix further supports this uncertainty."
