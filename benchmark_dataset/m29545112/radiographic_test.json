            "findings": "Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. Lung bases are without focal opacification. Tiny centrilobular nodules are noted in the left lower lobe which are non-specific but may be related to aspiration. The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without discrete masses or lesions. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation identified. The gallbladder is moderately distended with significant mural edema and two large peripherally calcified gallstones, one of which appears impacted within the gallbladder neck. Gallbladder mucosa demonstrates patchy hyperenhancement with an outpouching noted along the lateral aspect. Trace free fluid noted within the dependent portions of the abdomen. Findings are concerning for cholecystitis complicated by contained rupture. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Bilateral kidneys are without concerning masses or hydronephrosis. Multiple rounded hypodensities identified bilaterally, too small to characterize, but are most consistent with simple cysts. A large parapelvic cyst is noted on the left. The bladder is collapsed and grossly normal. Prostate is normal. Seminal vesicles are prominent. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. Sigmoid diverticulosis present without surrounding inflammatory change. The appendix is visualized and normal. Rectum is unremarkable. No lymphadenopathy identified. Minimal atherosclerotic changes identified within the aorta without aneurysmal change or dissection. Ostia of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are widely patent. The hepatic, left, right and main portal veins and their major tributaries are widely patent. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions identified.",
