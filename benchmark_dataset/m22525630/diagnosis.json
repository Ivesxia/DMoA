        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 6 days of periumbilical pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Clinical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ and suprapubic region, and imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis) showed an abnormal appendix with mucosal hyperemia, dilation, and mild periappendiceal fat stranding, which supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
