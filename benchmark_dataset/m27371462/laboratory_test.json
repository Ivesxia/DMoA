The CBD measures up to 10 mm, which is dilated. The CT shows a 10-mm right adrenal lesion, kidneys enhancing and excreting contrast symmetrically, with no hydronephrosis or mass. Focal segment of sigmoid colon demonstrates mild circumferential wall thickening, mucosal enhancement, and pericolonic fat stranding, with inflamed diverticula.
