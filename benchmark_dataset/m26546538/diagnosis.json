        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, specifically a dull ache in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by tenderness to palpation in that area. CT findings revealed a dilated appendix measuring up to 9.8 mm with surrounding fat inflammation, consistent with acute appendicitis. No evidence of perforation or fluid collection was noted, corroborating the diagnosis."
