        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with generalized abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant. Imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis) demonstrated a dilated appendix with an appendicolith, free fluid, and inflammatory fat stranding, indicating perforation. The presence of yellow discharge from the cervix and right adnexal tenderness were noted but were considered related rather to the appendicitis."
