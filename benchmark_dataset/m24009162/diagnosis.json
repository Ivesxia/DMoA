        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the presence of RLQ tenderness, thickened and hyperemic appendiceal walls with a dilated lumen observed on the CT scan, along with associated ascites and fat stranding around the inflamed appendix. No other abdominal conditions were identified to account for the symptoms, and CT findings showed no abscess or perforation."
