        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain that radiated to the back, which began after a meal high in fat. The ultrasound findings indicated a mildly distended gallbladder containing sludge and a stone in the neck of the gallbladder, which did not move with repositioning, consistent with cholecystitis."
