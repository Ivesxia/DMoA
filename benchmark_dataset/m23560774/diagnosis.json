        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute-onset abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by a large-volume episode of nonbloody, non-bilious emesis, and diffuse abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant rebound tenderness and imaging findings of subtle hyperemia of the appendix wall with mild periappendiceal fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of appendicitis."
