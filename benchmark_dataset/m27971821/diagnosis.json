        "final_diagnosis": "Acute nonperforated appendicitis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sharp, constant lower abdominal pain primarily in the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Laboratory results showed an elevated WBC count of 17.7. A CT scan revealed a thickened appendix with fat stranding, indicative of appendicitis. Furthermore, the physical exam showed local tenderness in the RLQ without rebound or guarding, which supported the diagnosis."
