        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical history of abdominal pain that initially started in the epigastric and periumbilical areas, later localizing to the right lower quadrant, along with physical examination findings of tenderness in the right lower quadrant. The CT findings confirmed the diagnosis with a dilated appendix, surrounding fat stranding, and thickening of the cecum at the appendiceal orifice."
