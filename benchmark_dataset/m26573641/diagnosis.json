        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, which worsened and was associated with mild nausea. Ultrasound findings showed a distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no evidence of gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The absence of biliary dilation further supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
