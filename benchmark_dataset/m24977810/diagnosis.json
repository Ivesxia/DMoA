    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain described as 'needle stabs', accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination indicated abdominal tenderness but no rebound or guarding, which aligns with acute appendicitis. Imaging findings showed gas-filled loops of small bowel and no free air under the diaphragm, ruling out other acute abdominal conditions."
