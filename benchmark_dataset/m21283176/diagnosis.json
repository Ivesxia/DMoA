        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, chills, nausea, and bilious vomiting. Ultrasound findings revealed a distended gallbladder with mural edema, pericholecystic fluid, and multiple gallstones, which were consistent with acute cholecystitis. The positive sonographic Murphy's sign further supported this diagnosis."
