Aortic valve calcifications. Liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys show no acute abnormalities. Bilateral renal hypodensities predominantly too small to characterize. A 3.2-cm round fluid density lesion in the right kidney likely represents a simple cyst. A 5.4-cm fluid density lesion arising from the right kidney likely represents a cyst. Mild wall thickening of the ascending colon with adjacent stranding likely secondary to recent polypectomy. Gallbladder is distended with mild adjacent stranding and fluid. A small hyperdense stone in the gallbladder. The appendix is not visualized, with no secondary signs of acute right lower quadrant inflammation. Markedly enlarged prostate, right-sided fat-containing inguinal hernia, moderate arterial atherosclerotic calcifications, and degenerative changes in the spine.",
