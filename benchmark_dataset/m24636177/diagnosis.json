        "final_diagnosis": "pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with midepigastric abdominal pain after eating a fried breakfast sandwich, which is a common trigger for gallbladder-related conditions and pancreatic inflammation. The patient has a history of gallstones, and similar past episodes were noted, indicating potential gallbladder pathology. The abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the midepigastrium without signs of rebound or guarding, which supports a diagnosis of pancreatitis due to the meal intake and symptomatology."
