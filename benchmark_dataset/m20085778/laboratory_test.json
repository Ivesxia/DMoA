A focus of gas is seen adjacent to the sigmoid, which raises concern for microperforation vs prominent diverticulum. There is a 1.2 x 0.7 cm adjacent low density focus which is concerning for small/early abscess formation. The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals are normal. The kidneys demonstrate symmetric contrast enhancement and brisk excretion. A 13-mm simple cyst is seen within the inferior pole of the left kidney. The small bowel is normal in caliber and enhancement. The remainder of the colon is normal in appearance.",
