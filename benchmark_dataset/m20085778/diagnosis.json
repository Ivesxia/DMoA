        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was suggested by abdominal CT findings, which showed stranding around the distal sigmoid colon, focally thickened bowel wall, and concern for microperforation or prominent diverticulum. Additionally, clinical presentation included lower abdominal pain and small bright red blood, consistent with diverticular disease."
