        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 5 days of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain that worsened after eating, coupled with previous imaging showing gallstones and the presence of sludge, which supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Physical examination demonstrated tender RUQ and voluntary guarding, and ultrasound findings indicated distended gallbladder without prior evidence of acute inflammation."
