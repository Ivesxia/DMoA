        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis is supported by the patient's history of gallstones and the presence of epigastric pain with elevated lipase levels. Imaging studies showed gallstones, mild gallbladder wall edema, and findings consistent with mild acute interstitial pancreatitis. The absence of other complications, evidenced by normal pancreatic duct caliber and no peripancreatic fluid collection, reinforces the diagnosis."
