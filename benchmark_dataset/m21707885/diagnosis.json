        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cholecystitis was supported by the ultrasound findings, which revealed a large shadowing gallstone near the gallbladder fundus and mild circumferential wall thickening. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, along with tenderness during the ultrasound, contributed to this conclusion."
