        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is supported by the patient's history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, the presence of multiple gallstones, a distended gallbladder with extensive wall edema, and hyperemia noted on ultrasound. Additionally, the positive sonographic sign further corroborates the diagnosis."
