        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with several hours of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Initial suspicion was stomach flu, but worsening pain led to an ED visit. A CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a dilated appendix (up to 9 mm) with intraluminal fluid and appendicoliths, confirming the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
