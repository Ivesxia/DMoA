        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of sharp epigastric pain and nausea, which progressed to the right upper quadrant. Past episodes of elevated transaminases during similar episodes suggest a diagnosis of pancreatitis. The MRCP revealed small stones in the gallbladder without evidence of choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis, supporting the diagnosis of cholelithiasis."
