        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which worsened over two weeks, and imaging revealed multiple gallstones with a large stone in the cystic duct. The presence of cholelithiasis and mild pericholecystic fluid, alongside the characteristic symptoms, supported the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis."
