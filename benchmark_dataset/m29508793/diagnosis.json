        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated Appendicitis with associated abscess",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain that initially localized to the left lower quadrant and then migrated to the right side, along with a fever, which raised concerns for pathology in the abdomen. Imaging revealed a large gas and fluid collection consistent with an abscess from a ruptured appendix, supported by the presence of an appendicolith and inflammatory changes, thus confirming the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
