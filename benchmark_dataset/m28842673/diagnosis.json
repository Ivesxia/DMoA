        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient presenting with vague abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by anorexia and diarrhea for 24 hours. The CT scan revealed a dilated appendix measuring up to 1 cm with thickened and hyperemic walls, consistent with appendicitis. There was no evidence of complications such as periappendiceal fluid or extraluminal air."
