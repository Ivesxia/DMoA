Mild pericholecystic stranding is identified. Following contrast administration, there is irregular enhancement of the gallbladder wall suggestive of impending gangrenous changes. A small stone is seen in the cystic duct obstructing the cystic duct and gallbladder. The liver shows slight heterogeneous enhancement of segment 4 and 5 due to increased inflammation in the gallbladder.",
