        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 36 hours of abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), with tenderness to palpation in the RLQ. The CT scan indicated a bulbous appendiceal tip measuring up to 8 mm with mild adjacent fat stranding, which is consistent with appendicitis. No other significant findings were noted to suggest an alternative diagnosis."
