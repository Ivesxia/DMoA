There is normal hepatopetal portal venous flow. Numerous stones are noted in the gallbladder which is minimally distended, but the gallbladder wall is markedly thickened and edematous, measuring up to 10 mm in diameter. No perihepatic or pericholecystic fluid. Small lymph nodes in the porta hepatis measure up to 7 mm in short axis, not pathologically enlarged, likely reactive.",
