        "final_diagnosis": "Calculus of gallbladder with other cholecystitis, without mention of obstruction",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute epigastric and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which was exacerbated by inspiration. The ultrasound showed numerous stones in the gallbladder with a markedly thickened and edematous wall, indicative of cholecystitis. The lack of biliary ductal dilation and the absence of other abdominal pathology supported the diagnosis."
