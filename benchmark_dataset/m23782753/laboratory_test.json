Scattered diverticula in this region, although an inflamed diverticulum is not definitively seen. No extraluminal air or evidence of abscess. The remainder of the large and small bowel is normal in appearance, without wall thickening, surrounding inflammatory changes or mesenteric hyperemia. The appendix is normal. A small amount of fluid tracks within the mesentery, particularly along the left abdomen and pelvis. The urinary bladder, distal ureters, uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.",
