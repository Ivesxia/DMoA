        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant, low-grade fever, and evidence of constipation. CT imaging revealed asymmetric wall thickening and edema of a 6-cm segment of the descending colon with pronounced pericolonic inflammatory changes, indicating diverticulitis. No other causes of abdominal pain were noted, as the rest of the abdominal organs appeared normal."
