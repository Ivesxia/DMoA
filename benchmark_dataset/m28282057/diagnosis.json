        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain, localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A history of recent colonoscopy showed colitis of the entire length of the colon, with pending biopsies for further evaluation. The symptoms, examination findings, and recent colonoscopy contribute to the diagnosis of appendicitis, alongside inflammatory bowel disease."
