        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after eating, which are symptoms indicative of a gallbladder issue. The ERCP findings revealed a centrally located intraluminal filling defect in the common bile duct correlating with a common bile duct stone, and the presence of calcified gallstones suggests complications related to the gallbladder, leading to the diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis."
