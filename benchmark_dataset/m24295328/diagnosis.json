        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of periumbilical pain that later localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), supported by the CT findings revealing a dilated appendix (1.2 cm) with thickened walls and periappendiceal stranding. There was also mild discomfort in both the periumbilical and RUQ regions. The absence of other significant findings in the abdomen and normal examinations of other organs further supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
