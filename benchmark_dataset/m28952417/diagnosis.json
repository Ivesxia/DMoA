        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain migrating from the umbilical region, the significant dilation of the appendix with a maximum diameter of 15 mm seen on CT, presence of an appendicolith, and extensive fat stranding around the appendix. Additionally, the absence of other significant findings such as bowel obstruction and the normal appearance of other abdominal organs corroborates the diagnosis."
