        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that migrated from the periumbilical region to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) over 12 hours, alongside mild tenderness in the RLQ. An ultrasound revealed a fluid-filled, noncompressible structure in the RLQ, consistent with appendicitis."
