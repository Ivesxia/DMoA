Nondistended gallbladder normal. The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size. The pancreas is without focal lesion. Adrenal glands unremarkable. Kidneys demonstrate symmetric nephrograms with prompt contrast excretion. No focal lesion or hydronephrosis. Stomach moderately distended. Appendix demonstrates wall thickening, adjacent adenopathy, and trace surrounding fat stranding with an appendicolith noted. No drainable fluid collection.",
