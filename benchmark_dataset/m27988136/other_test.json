            "findings": "There is a small amount of fluid around the pancreatic body and tail. The pancreatic duct is smooth with normal caliber. A 7 mm cystic lesion of the pancreatic body adjacent to the main duct has no complex features or solid enhancement. Numerous gallstones are present within the gallbladder. The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are normal in caliber. Two tiny equivocal filling defects are noted which could represent nonobstructing common duct stones. A 12-mm lesion of hepatic segment IV is mildly hyperintense to adjacent hepatic parenchyma on T2-weighted images and shows progressive peripheral nodular contrast enhancement, consistent with hemangioma. There is a decrease in signal intensity of the background hepatic parenchyma on T1-weighted opposed-phase images relative to in-phase images consistent with fatty infiltration. A tiny simple cyst of the right kidney is noted. The spleen is normal in size. The adrenal glands, left kidney, stomach, and loops of bowel are unremarkable. The celiac trunk, SMA, and renal arteries are patent.",
