        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting, which are clinical indicators of acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound findings showed multiple echogenically shadowing stones in the gallbladder, but the gallbladder was not distended, and there was no thickening of the wall or pericholecystic fluid. This information supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
