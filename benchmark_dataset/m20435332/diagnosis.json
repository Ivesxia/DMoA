        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of right lower abdominal pain, CT findings indicating a dilated appendix with hyperenhancing wall and surrounding fat stranding, which suggested inflammation. The presence of an appendicolith further confirmed the diagnosis."
