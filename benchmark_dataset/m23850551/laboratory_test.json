No drainable collections or evidence of free air. The stomach and the remainder of the visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal. Liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete promptly and are within normal limits. There is a tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney which is too small to characterize. The abdominal aorta is normal. Bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Uterus not definitely visualized.",
