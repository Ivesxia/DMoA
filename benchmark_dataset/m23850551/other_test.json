            "findings": "In the right lower quadrant, there is a 12 mm blind-ending tubular structure in the expected region of the appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and a hyperdense focus at the proximal portion consistent with an appendicolith. No drainable collections or evidence of free air. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. A tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney is too small to characterize. The bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. The uterus is not definitely visualized and may be atrophic or absent. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.",
