            "findings": "The visualized lung bases are clear. The visualized heart is normal without pericardial effusion. In the right lower quadrant, there is a 12 mm blind-ending tubular structure in the expected region of the appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and a hyperdense focus at the proximal portion consistent with an appendicolith. There are no drainable collections or evidence of free air. The stomach and the remainder of the visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is a tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney which is too small to characterize. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete promptly and are within normal limits. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and contour. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. The bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. The uterus is not definitely visualized and may be atrophic or absent. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.",
