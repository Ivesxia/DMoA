        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of sharp abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, and the CT findings of an 11 mm dilated fluid-filled appendix with hyperemic walls. Additionally, there was a small pocket of free fluid adjacent to the appendix, but no extraluminal free air was identified to suggest perforation."
