        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain after eating fatty meals, along with the recent episode of RUQ/epigastric pain after consuming a burrito, aligns with the clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis. The pain was consistent with prior episodes and resolved after several hours without pain medication, suggesting a gallbladder-related issue. Additionally, physical examination indicated mild tenderness in the RUQ without signs of rebound or guarding, and radiographic findings did not indicate other acute abdominal conditions."
