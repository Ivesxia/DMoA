        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, physical examination findings including focal tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant, and positive Rovsing sign. Additionally, the CT scan showed a dilated appendix with hyperenhancement and minimal adjacent stranding, consistent with early acute appendicitis."
