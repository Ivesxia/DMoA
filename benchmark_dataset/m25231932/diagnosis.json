        "differential_diagnosis": "Diverticulosis of large intestine without perforation or abscess without bleeding",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1-day history of abdominal pain that initially was vague but became localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ. A CT scan showed a dilated appendix with accompanying mild fat stranding, which supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Additionally, diverticulosis was identified but without complications."
