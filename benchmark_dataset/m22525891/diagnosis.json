        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, tenderness in the RUQ, and findings of gallstones in a distended gallbladder on ultrasound. There was no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid, but the clinical signs were consistent with acute cholecystitis."
