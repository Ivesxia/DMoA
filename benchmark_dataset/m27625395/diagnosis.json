    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain and a history of intermittent epigastric pain triggered by eating, which escalated after eating, indicating possible acute abdominal pathology. The pain was localized to the periumbilical area and radiated to the lower quadrants, which is consistent with pancreatitis. Additionally, the absence of other symptoms such as emesis or chest pain supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
