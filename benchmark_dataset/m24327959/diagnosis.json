        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that started as periumbilical and migrated to the right lower quadrant, with signs of tenderness in that area. The presence of a low-grade fever, elevated white blood cell count (12.7), and a CT scan revealing a 7mm dilated appendix with mild periappendiceal stranding supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
