        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with mid-epigastric abdominal pain, fever, and tenderness in the RUQ, alongside elevated amylase and LFTs, consistent with pancreatitis. The febrile response, along with the clinical exams and imaging results, indicated cholangitis and pneumonia. Troponin levels suggested demand ischemia, while clinical signs pointed towards Klebsiella sepsis and hypoxia as contributing factors."
