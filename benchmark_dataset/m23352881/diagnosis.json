        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that escalated to recurrent emesis, including bile with small flecks of blood, suggesting a gastrointestinal issue. The presence of heartburn and epigastric pain prior to the onset of abdominal symptoms points towards pancreatitis as a likely diagnosis. The patient also has risk factors such as untreated prostate cancer and a history of GERD, which could influence the presentation."
