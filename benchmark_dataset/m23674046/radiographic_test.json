The mass shows peripheral enhancement. There is a 6 mm T2 hyperintense cystic structure in the tail of the pancreas likely representing a side branch IPMN. The liver shows a 7 mm T2 hyperintensity, likely a biliary hamartoma. Multiple tiny layering gallstones are noted in the gallbladder. The kidneys and adrenal glands are normal bilaterally, with a 7 mm T2 hyperintensity in the left kidney likely a simple cyst.",
