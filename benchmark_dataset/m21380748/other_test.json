            "findings": "Dependent atelectasis at the lung bases. A gallstone is present. Peripancreatic fat stranding with a small amount of adjacent free fluid consistent with acute pancreatitis. No fluid collection or pancreatic necrosis seen. A 9 mm hypodensity in the left kidney is too small to characterize. Colonic diverticula seen without evidence for inflammation. Evaluation of the pelvis limited due to artifact from right hip hardware, but bladder, seminal vesicles, prostate, and rectum demonstrate no acute abnormalities.",
