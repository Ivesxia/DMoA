        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 24 hours of diffuse abdominal pain localizing to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), without nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen, with no rebound or guarding, suggesting an acute process. The findings from abdomen radiograph indicated multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, which supports the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
