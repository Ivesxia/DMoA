        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis and acute cholangitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with localized left upper quadrant (LUQ) and right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, along with notable tenderness in those areas. Imaging findings showed a distended gallbladder with moderate wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, and multiple gallstones, highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Additionally, a filling defect in the distal common bile duct compatible with a stone indicated choledocholithiasis, and mild dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts suggested cholangitis."
