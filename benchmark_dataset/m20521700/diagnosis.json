    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Early acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and right upper quadrant pain that began suddenly, which was suggestive of gallbladder pathology. The sharp pain radiating to the side and back, along with the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fever, pointed towards acute cholecystitis. Chills noted that morning could indicate a possible inflammatory process. The patient's past medical history did not include previous gallbladder disease, which makes the acute presentation more significant."
