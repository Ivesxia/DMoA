        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, initially periumbilical and later localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and chills. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the RLQ and a positive Rosving's sign. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a dilated appendix measuring approximately 7-8 mm with fluid and mild periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
