The gallbladder is mildly distended without gallbladder wall thickening, edema or pericholecystic fluid. A duplex right kidney with a duplicated collecting system. A subcentimeter hypodensity in the lower pole of the left kidney likely represents a renal cyst. Tubular, fluid-filled and rim-enhancing structure in the right lower quadrant measuring 14 mm, thought to represent dilation of the appendiceal tip. No free air or ascites.",
