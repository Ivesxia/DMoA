        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, fever, and a CT scan revealed that the appendix was borderline in size with potential hyperemia and trace fluid, suggestive of acute appendicitis despite no significant fat stranding. Further findings indicated possible slight jejunal wall thickening but no other diagnoses were specifically outlined."
