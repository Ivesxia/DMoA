        "differential_diagnosis": "COPD exacerbation, obstructive sleep apnea",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that shifted from epigastric to right upper quadrant (RUQ), which, combined with the lack of improvement in respiratory symptoms after treatment for COPD exacerbation, warranted a surgical consult. The imaging findings, including the successful cannulation of the gallbladder and the opacification of the biliary ducts with no evidence of dilatation or stenosis, supported the diagnosis of acute gangrenous cholecystitis."
