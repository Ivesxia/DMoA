        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Diverticulitis with perforation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1-day history of abdominal pain that began in the epigastric region and became more diffuse, accompanied by mild nausea and low-grade fevers. The abdominal exam revealed tenderness and mild distension without rebound or guarding, indicating an acute abdominal process. The lack of chronicity and absence of significant past medical history suggested an acute event, leading to the conclusion of diverticulitis with perforation."
