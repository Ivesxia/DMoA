No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct is mildly prominent at approximately 6 mm, overall less dilated compared to a previous measurement of 1 cm. The gallbladder appears normal without evidence of stones. The head and body of the pancreas are unremarkable, though the tail is poorly evaluated. Liver parenchyma is mildly heterogeneous, but no evidence of fatty infiltration.",
