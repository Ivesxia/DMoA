        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain that had been ongoing for one day. The physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant without rebound, guarding, or rigidity, which are classic signs of appendicitis. The presence of Escherichia coli from laboratory tests may suggest an infectious process consistent with appendicitis."
