        "final_diagnosis": "Unspecified acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Urinary tract infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which was sharp and localized, along with imaging findings of a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, the urinalysis suggested an infection, leading to the consideration of a urinary tract infection."
