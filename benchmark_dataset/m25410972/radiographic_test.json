            "findings": "Peripheral opacity at the right lung base likely representing focal scarring. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.5 cm, with wall thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis. No drainable fluid collection or extraluminal gas is seen. Grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1 is again seen, with vacuum phenomena at L5/S1 slightly more prominent.",
            "changes_over_time": "The peripheral opacity at the right lung base is not significantly changed compared with previous study. Vacuum phenomena at L5/S1 is also re-demonstrated, slightly more prominent."
