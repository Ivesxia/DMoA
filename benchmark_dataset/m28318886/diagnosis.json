        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis with associated fluid collection/phlegmon",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging findings from a CT abdomen and pelvis, which indicated a large amount of phlegmon and fluid in the expected location of the appendix, suggestive of a contained perforation. The presence of a potential appendicolith, along with the patient's symptoms of persistent RLQ pain and chills, further corroborated the diagnosis."
