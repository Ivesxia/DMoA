    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain, described as twisting/cramping and occurring intermittently. The pain duration and description, along with the patient's history of abdominal pain potentially attributed to gastritis, led to the consideration of acute pancreatitis as the primary issue. The absence of fever, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms further supported this diagnosis."
