        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was supported by the patient's presentation of left upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase level of 1258, and CT findings showing inflammation in the pancreas along with fat stranding. The absence of gallstones and history of alcohol intake, alongside the overall clinical context of metastatic small cell lung cancer, helped confirm this diagnosis."
