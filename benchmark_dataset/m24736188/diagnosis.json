        "final_diagnosis": "Acute diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of crampy abdominal pain, coupled with CT findings showing disproportional fat stranding around a loop of the rectosigmoid colon with scattered diverticula, supported the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. No evidence of complications such as drainable fluid collection or microperforation was noted, which further corroborated this diagnosis."
