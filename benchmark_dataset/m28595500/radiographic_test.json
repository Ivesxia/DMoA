Minimal dependent atelectasis noted, but no pleural effusion. Liver enhances homogeneously without concerning lesions. Mild diffuse periportal edema present. No biliary dilatation or concerning lesions in kidneys, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, or adrenal glands. The remainder of the colon is unremarkable. A 2.5-cm right adnexal cyst noted, with a small amount of simple free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Degenerative changes in the spine most severe at the L5-S1 level.",
