        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that began 9 hours prior, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain was waxing and waning in intensity, and the patient reported minimal relief with Tylenol. These symptoms, along with the physical examination and imaging findings, led to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The test results did not show any growth, and the abdominal exam noted appropriate tenderness."
