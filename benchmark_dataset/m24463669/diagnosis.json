        "differential_diagnosis": "steatohepatitis, diabetes, obesity, hypertension",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain, nausea, and a history of significant alcohol intake, which is consistent with acute pancreatitis. Additionally, ultrasound findings indicated fatty infiltration of the liver along with the presence of gallstones. Key symptoms such as epigastric tenderness and the absence of a prior history of alcohol withdrawal episodes supported the diagnosis."
