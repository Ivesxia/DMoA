        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by CT findings showing a dilated appendix at the base measuring up to 12 mm, with appendiceal wall thickening and mucosal enhancement, as well as adjacent fat edema and stranding. The presence of these findings in the right lower quadrant supports the diagnosis."
