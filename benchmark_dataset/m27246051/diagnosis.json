        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), associated with nausea and vomiting, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. A CT scan showed mild mucosal hyperemia of the appendix and mild fat stranding, further supporting the diagnosis. The prior episode of giardia infection was considered but was determined to be resolved."
