        "differential_diagnosis": "Adrenal insufficiency, Atrial fibrillation, Renal transplant",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fatigue, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on exertion, which were evaluated in the context of his complex medical history including multiple comorbidities. The acute presentation, alongside ongoing respiratory issues and hospitalization records, led to the consideration that the fatigue and weakness might be related to diverticulitis, while other conditions such as adrenal insufficiency and atrial fibrillation were monitored as contributing or secondary factors."
