        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pancreatitis was supported by an elevated lipase level of 990 and a history of abdominal pain. The presence of a pancreatic head mass was indicated by imaging findings during an MRCP examination, which noted an abrupt loss of the pancreatic duct adjacent to the CBD stricture, suggesting a mass effect possibly related to adenocarcinoma following brushings that were suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma."
