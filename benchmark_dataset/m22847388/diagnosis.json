        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with post-prandial epigastric pain radiating to the right upper quadrant and back, associated with nausea and vomiting, which aligns with the clinical presentation of acute gallstone pancreatitis.

The patient's past history of similar abdominal pain after meals and family history of gallstones support the diagnosis."
