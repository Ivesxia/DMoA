The head and body of the gland were interrogated. The tail of the gland could not be visualized as it was retrocecal. Normal arterial and venous waveforms are identified within the transplanted pancreas as well as within at least 1 limb of the Y graft. No peripancreatic fluid collections. The pancreas itself appears mildly echogenic.",
