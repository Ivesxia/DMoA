        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe left flank pain, vomiting, and dyspnea, which prompted further evaluation. Initial workup, including imaging studies and laboratory tests, did not reveal an obvious cause for pain other than pancreatitis. The patient's symptoms and clinical signs, along with the lack of findings in the chest and abdominal studies, supported the final diagnosis of pancreatitis."
