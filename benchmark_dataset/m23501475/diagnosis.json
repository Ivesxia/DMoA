        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset epigastric pain after eating, with nausea and an acid taste in their mouth. The ultrasound revealed multiple large gallstones in the gallbladder and acute cholecystitis was suggested given the tenderness in the epigastrium with no distension or wall edema noted. The presence of gallstones and epigastric pain further supported a diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
