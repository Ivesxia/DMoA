        "final_diagnosis": "Necrotizing pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis was supported by significant peripancreatic fatty stranding, fluid, and thickening of the left perirenal fascia, along with hypoenhancement of the pancreatic tail consistent with necrosis demonstrated on CT imaging. The patient's clinical history including abdominal pain, high lipase levels, and history of alcohol abuse further corroborated this diagnosis."
