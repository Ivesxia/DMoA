        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with constant, sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain, mild nausea, and no fever, which raised suspicion for appendicitis. A CT scan showed an enlarged appendix with hyper-enhancing walls and significant surrounding fat stranding, indicating acute appendicitis. Fluid adjacent to the sigmoid colon and other abdominal structures appeared normal, supporting the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis without a clear abscess."
