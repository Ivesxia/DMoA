Appendix measures up to 8 mm with air in its tip and no periappendiceal inflammation. Associated inflammatory lymph nodes in an ileocolic distribution, largest 6 mm. Findings suggest cecal perforation confined to the right lower quadrant. Multiple diverticula in the sigmoid colon suggest diverticulosis.",
