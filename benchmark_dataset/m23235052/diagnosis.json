        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presents with worsening weakness, fatigue, and vomiting, alongside a medical history of pancreatic cancer and treatment with gemcitabine. Physical examination and vital signs indicate signs of infection and sepsis. The acute cholecystitis diagnosis is supported by abdominal tenderness in the RUQ and symptoms consistent with biliary obstruction. The percutaneous biliary drainage procedure further indicates complications related to the acute cholecystitis."
