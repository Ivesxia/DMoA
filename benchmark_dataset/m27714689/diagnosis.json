        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is supported by the patient's presentation of RUQ pain following a large meal, episodes of nausea and diarrhea, and the CT findings of a distended gallbladder with circumferential wall edema and surrounding fat stranding, which are concerning for inflammation. Potential gallstones were also considered due to the observed high density in the neck of the gallbladder."
