        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), which was more intense than previous experiences. Historical imaging showed severe occlusion and narrowing but no acute ischemia. The gallbladder was collapsed with no evidence of fluid collection, indicating acalculous cholecystitis, which aligns with her symptoms and prior medical history."
