            "findings": "The visualized lung bases are clear with no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands and both kidneys appear unremarkable. Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathology. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. Intra-abdominal vasculature appears unremarkable. Intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable. The appendix measures approximately 7 mm with minimal surrounding appendiceal stranding at the tip and with no significant contrast noted intraluminally within the appendix. Findings are concerning for appendicitis in the correct clinical setting. The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.",
