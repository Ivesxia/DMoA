        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening abdominal pain, bloody, mucousy stools, and decreased appetite consistent with prior ulcerative colitis flares. Laboratory findings showed elevated lipase and CRP, and CT imaging indicated bowel wall thickening suggestive of colitis. The history of chronic colitis and the clinical presentation led to the final diagnosis."
