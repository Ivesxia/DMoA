        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with episodic right flank and right upper quadrant pain that worsened progressively over a week, with onset following meals, severe non-remitting pain, and associated nausea. The physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the RUQ without signs of peritonitis, and no additional concerning symptoms such as fever or jaundice were noted. These findings support the diagnosis of early cholecystitis."
