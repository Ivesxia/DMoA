        "differential_diagnosis": "Cholelithiasis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain which led to imaging that suggested gallstone pancreatitis. Additional findings showed a change in the position of gallstones and mild gallbladder wall edema, supporting the diagnosis. Other symptoms were resolved, and no other significant gastrointestinal issues were noted."
