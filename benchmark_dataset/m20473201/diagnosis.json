        "final_diagnosis": "acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is supported by the patient's presentation of sharp, non-radiating abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), associated with nausea and dry-heaving. The physical examination revealed focal tenderness in the RLQ, positive Rovsing sign, and positive obturator sign. CT imaging demonstrated a dilated appendix at its mid to distal portion with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
