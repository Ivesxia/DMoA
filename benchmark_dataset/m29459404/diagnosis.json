        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of gradual onset right upper quadrant pain that began approximately 2 hours after eating, suggesting a possible gallbladder issue. Clinical examination revealed positive right upper quadrant pain. The diagnostic process included a chest radiograph which was normal, supporting the absence of pulmonary issues and reinforcing the suspicion of a biliary cause."
