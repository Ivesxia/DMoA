Hypoattenuating lesion in segment IV of the liver likely represents a simple cyst. Small hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize. The appendix is approximately 6 mm with no surrounding fat stranding and no definite contrast seen within the appendix. Multilevel degenerative changes in osseous structures.",
