            "findings": "Visualized lung bases are clear with no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Normal heart and pericardium. Enhancing region within segment VII of the liver consistent with hemangioma. Hypoattenuating lesion in segment IV of the liver likely represents a simple cyst. Additional small hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize. The appendix measures approximately 6 mm and is at the upper limits of normal with no surrounding fat stranding. No definite contrast is seen within the appendix.",
