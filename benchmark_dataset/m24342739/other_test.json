Hypoattenuating lesion in segment IV of the liver likely represents a simple cyst. Additional small hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize. The appendix measures approximately 6 mm and is at the upper limits of normal with no surrounding fat stranding. No definite contrast seen within the appendix.",
