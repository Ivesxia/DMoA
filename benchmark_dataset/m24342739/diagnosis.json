        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with generalized abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and exhibited tenderness over McBurney's point with voluntary guarding, which suggested acute appendicitis. CT findings did not definitively show an inflamed or fluid-filled appendix but indicated it was at the upper limits of normal size."
