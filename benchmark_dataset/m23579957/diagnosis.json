        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including abdominal pain (specifically suprapubic pain), diarrhea, and vomiting, which worsened over time. The patient's history of end stage renal disease and recent gastrointestinal symptoms, in conjunction with imaging studies that revealed issues related to the gastrointestinal tract, contributed to this diagnosis."
