        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain that started in the epigastric region and migrated to the right lower quadrant, along with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The ultrasound findings revealed a dilated, mildly hyperemic noncompressible tubular structure consistent with an inflamed appendix."
