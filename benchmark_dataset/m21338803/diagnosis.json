        "final_diagnosis": "gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden sharp abdominal pain, located in the epigastrium, which was associated with shortness of breath. The history of recurrent pain and subsequent diagnosis of pancreatitis prompted further evaluation. Ultrasound findings indicated small layering gallstones within the gallbladder and slight gallbladder wall edema, consistent with inflammation likely secondary to the gallstones."
