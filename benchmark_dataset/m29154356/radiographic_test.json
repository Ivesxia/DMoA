            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "Trace right pleural effusion with mild to moderate bilateral dependent atelectasis. The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation, with no focal lesions, mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, and a distended gallbladder with thickened wall and extensive pericholecystic fat stranding. There is a hyperdense gallstone in the gallbladder fundus measuring 5 mm. Normal pancreas, spleen, and adrenals. Normal kidneys with small right renal hypodensities likely cysts. Small bowel loops and diverticulosis of the colon noted without wall thickening. Small amount of nonhemorrhagic free pelvic fluid. Normal bladder and distal ureters. No lymphadenopathy and extensive atherosclerotic disease with chronic occlusion of the proximal SMA. No evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture, with unchanged Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 and similar moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. Small right inguinal hernia containing fat and a large abdominal wall soft tissue defect compatible with an abdominal wound dehiscence requiring VAC closure.",
            "changes_over_time": "Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 is unchanged. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are similar to the prior study."
