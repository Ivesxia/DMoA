        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the CT findings, which showed a distended gallbladder with a thickened wall and extensive pericholecystic fat stranding, alongside the presence of a gallstone measuring 5 mm. These imaging characteristics are consistent with acute cholecystitis."
