    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis with peritoneal abscess",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included a 4-day history of abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), subjective fevers, nausea, and emesis. Imaging studies (CT Abdomen and Pelvis) revealed a dilated and thickened appendix with surrounding phlegmonous changes, consistent with acute appendicitis. Additionally, inflammatory changes at the cecum supported this diagnosis as there was no evidence of perforation or free air."
