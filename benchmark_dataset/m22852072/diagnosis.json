        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1 day history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which was sharp and persistent. Physical examination revealed RLQ focal tenderness without rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed hyperemia and enlargement of the appendix measuring up to 10 mm, consistent with appendicitis, and ruled out other abdominal conditions due to the lack of evidence of perforation, abscess formation, or other inflammatory changes."
