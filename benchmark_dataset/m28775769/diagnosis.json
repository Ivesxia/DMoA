        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The ultrasound findings showed a mildly distended gallbladder filled with stones and mild gallbladder wall thickening, which is consistent with acute cholecystitis. There were no signs of pericholecystic fluid, and the portal vein was patent. The patient's presentation included abdominal pain, which has now resolved, indicating possible acute cholecystitis leading to supportive treatment and intervention."
