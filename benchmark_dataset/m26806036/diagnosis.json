        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain that worsened over time, accompanied by nausea and anorexia. The pain was specific to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and was aggravated by walking. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the RLQ and right mid quadrant, along with guarding. These findings, along with the characteristic pain and associated symptoms, supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
