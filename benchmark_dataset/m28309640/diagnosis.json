        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain similar to previous episodes of GERD but also showed tenderness on exam, had a history of documented gallstones, and had a lipase level of 90. These findings led to a general surgery consult for evaluation of gallstone pancreatitis, but ultimately, the diagnosis was acute cholecystitis."
