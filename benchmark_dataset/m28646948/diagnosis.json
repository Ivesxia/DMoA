        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal discomfort localized to the right and just below the umbilicus, and CT imaging showed florid sigmoidal diverticulosis along with fat stranding consistent with diverticulitis. Additionally, there were locules of air suggesting microperforation, which supports the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis."
