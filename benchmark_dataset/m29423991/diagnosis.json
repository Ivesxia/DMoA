    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Necrotizing pancreatitis secondary to trauma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain following heavy alcohol consumption and trauma to the upper abdomen, alongside an extraordinarily elevated lipase level (13,500) and elevated liver function tests. These findings, combined with the need for ERCP, which was aborted due to severe duodenal edema, strongly indicated necrotizing pancreatitis."
