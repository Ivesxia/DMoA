        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute perforated gangrenous appendicitis was supported by MRI findings indicating a dilated appendix measuring up to 14 mm with periappendiceal edema and inflammatory change. Additionally, the patient's clinical presentation of abdominal pain, especially in the right mid abdomen, and lack of other gastrointestinal symptoms pointed towards appendicitis."
