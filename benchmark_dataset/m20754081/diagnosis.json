        "final_diagnosis": "Sigmoid Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Sigmoid colonic carcinoma with microperforation",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by the presence of focal thickening of the sigmoid colon, fatty stranding, and localized air bubbles within the mesentery noted on the CT abdomen. The absence of free intraperitoneal air and drainable abscess also contributed to this diagnosis. Consideration was given to excluding sigmoid colonic carcinoma due to segmental, circumferential mural thickening."
