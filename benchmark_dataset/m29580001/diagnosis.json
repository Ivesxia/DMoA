        "final_diagnosis": "Chronic cholecystitis with acute biliary colic.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient has a history of cholelithiasis and presented with recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Imaging revealed gallstones without cholecystitis, but given the recurrent symptoms and elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT 111, AST 200), alongside the patient's clinical presentation of ongoing pain, the diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis with acute biliary colic was established, warranting surgical intervention."
