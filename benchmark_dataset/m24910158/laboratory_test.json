            "findings": "The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is focal inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant abutting the lateral aspect of the ascending colon and cecum. Underlying colon is notable for focal wall thickening and a prominent fecolith within its lumen. Possible diverticulum is noted. The appendix is seen in close proximity to the inflammation and is mildly thickened though likely secondary. There is no visualized appendicolith. The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.
