        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound findings showed multiple mobile gallstones, and the gallbladder was not distended with no signs of edema or fluid. The absence of rebound or guarding and tenderness in the RUQ further supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
