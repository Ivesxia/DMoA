        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by CT imaging showing mucosal enhancement and enlargement of the appendix, measuring 7-8 mm. Other findings, such as the absence of periappendiceal fluid and no signs of diverticulitis, were also considered, ruling out other potential causes of the abdominal pain."
