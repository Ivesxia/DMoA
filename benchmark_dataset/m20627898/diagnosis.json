        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis was supported by abdominal CT findings which noted inflammation surrounding a diverticulum at the cecum, small foci of air within the diverticulum, and secondary wall thickening of the cecum. There was also minimal hyperemia at the base of the appendix, which was otherwise normal, helping to rule out appendicitis."
