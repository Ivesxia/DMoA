Most areas are isointense on ADC map with periventricular abnormalities indicating subacute infarcts. No evidence of chronic blood products, mass effect, or midline shift. Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease and moderate brain atrophy identified. A chronic infarct is seen in the right occipital lobe. Absence of flow signal in the left internal carotid artery indicative of occlusion.",
