        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Intra-abdominal abscesses, Occlusion of Left ICA",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis was supported by the presence of a 5 cm abscess under the diaphragm noted in the CT scan, along with the patient's symptoms including rigors, fever, nausea, and chills. The patient's history of diverticulosis also contributed to the reasoning, and the intra-abdominal abscesses were management issues stemming from this condition. Additionally, the MRI findings indicated occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, which was a pertinent finding but secondary to the diverticulitis."
