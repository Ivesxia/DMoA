        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe sharp epigastric and right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea. Ultrasound findings indicated the presence of small stones in the gallbladder, but no wall edema or cholecystic fluid, aligning with acute cholecystitis without obstruction. The patient's stable vital signs and physical examination findings support the diagnosis."
