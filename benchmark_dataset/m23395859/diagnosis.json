        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain that started around the umbilical area and migrated to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant on physical examination. Imaging findings from the CT scan showed an abnormally dilated and thickened appendix with associated inflammatory stranding, consistent with appendicitis."
