        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a three-day history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, described as sharp and non-radiating, accompanied by nausea and diminished appetite. Physical examination revealed exquisite tenderness in the RLQ with rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding, as well as a positive psoas sign. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis."
