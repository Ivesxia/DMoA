        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included abdominal pain, inability to keep food or liquids down, and findings from the EGD indicating extensive food impaction and gastric stricture. Laboratory results showed elevated lipase, and imaging suggested possible stricture in the stomach. The combination of these findings supports the diagnoses of pancreatitis and gastric outlet obstruction."
