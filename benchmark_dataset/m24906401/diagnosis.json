        "final_diagnosis": "perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was based on the patient's clinical presentation, which included acute abdominal pain, particularly localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), abdominal distention, and nausea. Imaging findings from a CT scan showed a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with mucosal hyperemia, adjacent fat stranding, and a bilobed distal appendix contour with a periappendiceal abscess, all consistent with perforated appendicitis."
