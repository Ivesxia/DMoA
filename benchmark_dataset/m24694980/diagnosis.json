        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of sharp, acute umbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant, slight nausea, vomiting, and imaging findings of a fluid-filled appendix measuring 9 mm in diameter associated with surrounding mesenteric fat stranding. CT results ruled out other abdominal conditions such as bile duct dilation, lymphadenopathy, and other organ abnormalities."
