        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by imaging results showing a tubular, blind-ending structure with evidence of mild wall thickening and a fluid-filled lumen in the right lower quadrant, which are consistent with appendicitis. The presence of mild right lower quadrant tenderness during the physical examination further corroborated this diagnosis."
