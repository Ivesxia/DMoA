A right paraovarian simple cyst measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.6 cm is seen. The left ovary contains an echogenic focus measuring 0.4 cm, unchanged from prior study and consistent with a dermoid. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. A blind-ending structure with gut signature was identified in the right lower quadrant, measuring 7 mm proximally and 9 mm distally, noncompressible, and accompanied by increased echogenicity of the surrounding peritoneal fat.",
