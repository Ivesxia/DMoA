A right paraovarian simple cyst measures 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.6 cm. The left ovary contains an echogenic focus measuring 0.4 cm, unchanged from prior study and consistent with a dermoid. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. A blind-ending structure with gut signature was identified in the right lower quadrant, measuring 7 mm proximally and up to 9 mm distally, noncompressible, accompanied by increased echogenicity of the surrounding peritoneal fat, representing acute appendicitis.",
