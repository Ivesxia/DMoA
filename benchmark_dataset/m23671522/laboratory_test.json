A hypodensity in the lateral edge of the left lobe of the liver, measuring 1.8 x 1.2 cm likely represents a hemangioma. An area of hypodensity in segment VIII measures 2 x 1.9 cm is likely a hemangioma but is not fully characterized. Significant stranding seen adjacent to the cecum and appendix with an appendicolith observed; the appendix is markedly dilated, measuring 1.6 cm. Discontinuity of the appendiceal wall compatible with a perforation. A small non-drainable fluid collection seen adjacent to the wall discontinuity indicative of phlegmonous changes/developing early abscess.",
