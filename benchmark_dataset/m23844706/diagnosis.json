        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, subjective fevers, and abdominal examination findings that included tenderness in the RLQ and a positive Rovsing's sign. CT imaging confirmed that the appendix was fluid-filled and dilated to 9 mm with adjacent fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis."
