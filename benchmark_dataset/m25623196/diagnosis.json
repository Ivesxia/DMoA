        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent symptoms of acute appendicitis. The CT scan showed mild dilation of the distal appendix measuring 12 mm with minimal adjacent fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of appendicitis. The absence of concerning findings such as extraluminal air or drainable fluid collection further reinforced this diagnosis."
