        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of cholelithiasis, severe right upper quadrant pain, elevated lipase levels (>3000), and CT findings showing ostsurgical changes without drainable fluid collection. The presence of elevated liver enzymes also contributed to the conclusion of gallstone pancreatitis."
