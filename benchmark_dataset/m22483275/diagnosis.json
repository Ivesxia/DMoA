        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 7-hour history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain described as sharp and stabbing, along with nausea, which prompted the visit to the ER. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the RUQ, and the patient's vital signs were stable. The ICD diagnosis specified calculus of the gallbladder with acute cholecystitis, indicating the presence of gallstones as a contributing factor to the condition."
