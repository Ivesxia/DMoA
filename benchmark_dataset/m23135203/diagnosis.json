        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the presence of abdominal pain predominantly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), fever, nausea, and ultrasound findings showing several large gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, and edema. Additionally, the absence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and microorganisms further indicated a non-infectious process consistent with inflammation."
