        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain for 10 hours, abdominal cramping, and tenderness in the RLQ upon palpation. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a rim-enhancing and dilated appendix measuring up to 9 mm with surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding, which is consistent with appendicitis."
