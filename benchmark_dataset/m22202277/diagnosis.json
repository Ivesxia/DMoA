        "final_diagnosis": "Mild Acute Pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute on sub-acute abdominal pain, specifically periumbilical and RUQ pain along with loose non-bloody stools and significant weight loss. The abdominal CT indicated minimal haziness between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, which correlates with mild acute pancreatitis, while other potential causes such as biliary obstruction or malignancy were ruled out based on CT findings."
