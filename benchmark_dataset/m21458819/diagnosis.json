        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, which was constant and accompanied by bilious vomiting. Physical examination revealed moderate tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant, supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Lack of fever and specific examination findings ruled out other acute abdominal conditions."
