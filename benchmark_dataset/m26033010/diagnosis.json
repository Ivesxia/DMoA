        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that was initially vague and low-grade, then progressed to localized pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Physical examination revealed rebound tenderness in the RLQ, and CT imaging showed a blind-ended tubular structure with mucosal enhancement and fat effacement, consistent with acute appendicitis."
