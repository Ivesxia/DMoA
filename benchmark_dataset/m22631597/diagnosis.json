    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis with microperforation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pelvic mass, possibly due to diverticulitis; Hydronephrosis of right ureter and kidney; Urinary retention with UTI; Multiple Myeloma; Acute renal failure due to obstruction/urinary retention; Dementia; Delirium; Systolic ejection murmur; Restless leg syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis with microperforation is supported by CT findings of circumferential thickening of the distal sigmoid with areas of extraluminal low attenuation suggesting abscess formation and localized free air indicative of microperforation. Additionally, the patient presented with worsening anemia, guaic positive stool, and signs of renal failure, which correlated with the findings of hydronephrosis due to an underlying pelvic mass."
