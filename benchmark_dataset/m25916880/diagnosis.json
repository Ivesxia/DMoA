        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which intensified leading to the use of ibuprofen. Ultrasound findings revealed two large gallstones and mild gallbladder wall edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis. Symptoms did not improve with antacids, and the presence of gallstones alongside the clinical signs led to the diagnosis."
