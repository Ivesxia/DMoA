        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening epigastric abdominal pain and nausea following an ERCP. Initial assessments including a non-contrast CT abdomen and gallbladder ultrasound showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation, no evidence of large stones, and the gallbladder appeared normal. His abdominal pain, tenderness, and history of gallstone-related symptoms led to the final diagnosis of pancreatitis and cholelithiasis."
