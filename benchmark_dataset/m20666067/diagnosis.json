        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 24-hour history of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, nausea, vomiting, and fever, which are consistent with appendicitis. The CT scan revealed a thick-walled, edematous structure in the right lower quadrant consistent with the appendix, along with periappendiceal fat stranding and the presence of a fecalith, which supports the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
