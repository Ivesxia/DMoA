        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with episodic right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain after meals, which escalated to vomiting. Ultrasound findings indicated multiple mobile nonobstructing gallstones without signs of acute cholecystitis, and there was no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. This combination of clinical symptoms and ultrasound results supported the diagnosis of cholelithiasis with cholecystitis."
