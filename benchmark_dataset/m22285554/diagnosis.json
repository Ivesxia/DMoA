        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of worsening right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, the CT findings indicating a dilated appendix (up to 8 mm) with minimal fat stranding, and the absence of free air or fluid. The patient's history of one bout of diarrhea and denial of systemic symptoms such as fever or chills further characterized the acute nature of the appendicitis."
