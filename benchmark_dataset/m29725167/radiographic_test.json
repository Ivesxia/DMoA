The wall of the appendix, particularly at the tip, is not well defined raising concern for perforation. A small amount of fluid is seen in the right paracolic gutter, and a small extraluminal more defined peripherally enhancing collection (11 x 13 mm) is adjacent to the base of the appendix. Remaining visualized loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable without evidence of obstruction.",
