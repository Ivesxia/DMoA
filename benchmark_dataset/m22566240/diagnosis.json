        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain and distention, associated with nausea and vomiting, along with a history of similar episodes. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant and signs suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Absence of fever and other concurrent symptoms helped to focus on gallbladder inflammation."
