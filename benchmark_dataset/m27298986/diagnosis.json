        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's sudden onset of severe epigastric pain, elevated lipase levels (1200), presence of gallstones, distended gallbladder with wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid. The clinical presentation, along with imaging findings and laboratory tests, confirmed the diagnosis."
