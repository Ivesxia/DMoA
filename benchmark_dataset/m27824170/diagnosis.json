        "differential_diagnosis": "Duodenal perforation, Groove pancreatitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Extensive inflammation of the second and third part of the duodenum with adjacent retroperitoneal phlegmon was noted. The inflammation is most suggestive of duodenitis, supported by CT findings indicating inflammation and stranding without free air. The presence of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia, along with hyperglycemia, indicated a new diagnosis of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus."
