        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of right upper quadrant pain, findings of sludge in the gallbladder on ultrasound, and subsequent fever. There was no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, which are typically indicative of more severe disease, but the presence of sludge and the clinical presentation warranted the diagnosis."
