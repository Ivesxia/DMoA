        "final_diagnosis": "acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of severe epigastric abdominal pain following a meal of fried chicken wings and beer, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant on physical examination. Ultrasound findings revealed the presence of multiple gallstones in a non-distended gallbladder without signs of acute inflammation, which corroborates the diagnosis."
