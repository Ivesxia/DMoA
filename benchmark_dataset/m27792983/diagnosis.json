        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic cholecystitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back, which is consistent with pancreatitis. The absence of fever and other symptoms supports the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis, especially in the context of prior hospitalization for kidney stones. The ERCP findings demonstrated a normal course and caliber of the pancreatic duct and biliary ducts, indicating that while pancreatitis is present, there are no current obstructive stones."
