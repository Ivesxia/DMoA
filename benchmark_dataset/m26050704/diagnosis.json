        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation includes a history of cholecystitis and cholecystectomy complicated by a cystic duct leak. He returned with abdominal pain similar to previous episodes and underwent an ERCP procedure for hepatic duct stenting. Imaging indicates fat stranding and fluid surrounding the pancreas, consistent with pancreatitis, thus supporting the final diagnosis."
