        "final_diagnosis": "Acute diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is supported by the CT findings of marked inflammation surrounding the sigmoid colon, colonic diverticulosis, and the presence of extraluminal gas, which raises concern for perforation. The absence of drainable abscess or evidence of peritonitis further corroborates the diagnosis."
