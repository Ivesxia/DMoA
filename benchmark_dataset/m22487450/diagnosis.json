        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of diffuse abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), nausea, vomiting, and tenderness on examination. Imaging findings from the CT scan indicated a mildly dilated, fluid-filled appendix with hyperenhancing wall and mild fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
