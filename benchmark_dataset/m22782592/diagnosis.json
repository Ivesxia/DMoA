        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain that had progressively worsened, along with a history of nausea and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a dilated appendix up to 11 mm with wall thickening, which is indicative of appendicitis. No other abdominal organs were abnormal, and no signs of perforation or abscess were observed."
