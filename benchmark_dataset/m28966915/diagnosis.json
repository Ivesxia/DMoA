        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset lower abdominal pain, worsening over the night along with a history of fatigue. CT scan of the abdomen revealed inflammation of the sigmoid colon with evidence of diverticulosis, without free air or abscess. Additionally, the creatinine level was elevated at 3.6, indicating acute on chronic kidney injury. These findings, alongside the symptoms and history, supported the final diagnosis."
