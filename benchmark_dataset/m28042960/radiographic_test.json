The gallbladder is distended, edematous, containing multiple gallstones including a 2.4 cm stone which appears impacted in the neck of the gallbladder. There is significant surrounding stranding without evidence of free air or adjacent fluid collections. There is an area of discontinuity in the mucosa, concerning for possible complicated cholecystitis by perforation. Subtle inflammation and wall edema of the loop of colon just adjacent to the gallbladder, likely reactive. An umbilical hernia containing fat is noted.",
