        "differential_diagnosis": "Cellulitis/erysipelas, Dementia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fevers, a rash, and bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), which supports the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. Imaging findings indicated mild thickening of the left lateroconal fascia and fat stranding in the region of sigmoid diverticulosis, which are consistent with diverticulitis. Other causes like cellulitis and erysipelas were considered due to the rash but were adjunct to the primary gastrointestinal finding."
