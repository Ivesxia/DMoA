    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, worsening over two days, accompanied by nausea. Notable findings included tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding, alongside an incarcerated umbilical hernia. The absence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and microorganisms in lab results suggest an acute inflammatory process related to the gallbladder. These clinical findings, alongside the patient's obesity and history of diabetes mellitus, supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
