                "lung": "The lung bases are grossly clear. No pleural or pericardial effusion.",

                "biliary": "No significant intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.",
                "pancreas": "Normal signal intensity and bulk. A punctate T2 hyperintense nonenhancing focus in the tail of the pancreas is most compatible with a side branch IPMN.",

                "adrenal glands": "Normal in size and shape.",

                "osseous": "No concerning osseous lesions. Several T2 hyperintense hemangiomas in thoracic spine. Multiple chronic compression deformities involving T11-L1, L3, and L5."
