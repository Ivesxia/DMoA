        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of worsening right lower quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and the physical examination findings of tenderness at McBurney's point. Additionally, the transabdominal ultrasound revealed a dilated and non-compressible distal blind-ending tubular structure in the right lower quadrant consistent with an inflamed appendix along with an appendicolith."
