        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe epigastric abdominal pain, history of significant alcohol use, and elevated lipase levels (1836), which supports the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Other gastrointestinal symptoms and a prior history of peptic ulcer disease were noted, but the acute presentation and laboratory findings were consistent with pancreatitis."
