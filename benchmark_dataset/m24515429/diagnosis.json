        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant (LLQ), low-grade fevers, and chills following a known history of diverticula. Imaging via CT scan showed marked wall thickening of the sigmoid colon with adjacent mild fat stranding, consistent with diverticulitis. No evidence of an underlying mass or free fluid was found, supporting the diagnosis."
