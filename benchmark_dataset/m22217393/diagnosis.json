    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute gallstone pancreatitis, Hepatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain along with elevated liver enzymes (AST 984, ALT 622) and lipase (296), consistent with pancreatitis likely secondary to gallstones, given her history of retained CBD stones and previous ERCPs. The abdominal ultrasound did not reveal stones in the common bile duct, but the clinical presentation aligns with acute gallstone pancreatitis."
