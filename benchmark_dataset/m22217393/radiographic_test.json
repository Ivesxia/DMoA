The common bile duct measures 5 mm in its greatest dimension and is followed down as far as possible, but the distal CBD is not well seen due to overlying bowel gas. There is no convincing evidence of stone in the distal CBD where evaluated. Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no gross abnormality.",
