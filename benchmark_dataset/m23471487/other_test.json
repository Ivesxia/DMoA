Enteric contrast passes through the small bowel to the large bowel without entering the appendix. A 2-mm left subpleural pulmonary nodule is noted. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear grossly unremarkable. Small and large bowel loops appear non-dilated without evidence of obstruction. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is seen. The bladder, distal ureters and uterus appear grossly unremarkable. No pelvic free air is identified. Trace amount of fluid surrounding the appendix in the right lower quadrant. No concerning osseous lesion is seen.",
