        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of sharp abdominal pain localized in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by symptoms of anorexia and vomiting. Imaging findings from a CT scan revealed a markedly thickened appendix measuring up to 13 mm, significant fat stranding adjacent to the appendix, and a small quantity of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter, which aligned with the diagnosis of appendicitis."
