        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis of proximal transverse colon",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "CT scan findings showed a short segment of bowel wall thickening with pericolonic fat stranding and diverticulosis, which are compatible with diverticulitis. There was also equivocal evidence for tiny extraluminal gas adjacent to the area of inflammation, raising the possibility of microperforation."
