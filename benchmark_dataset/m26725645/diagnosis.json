        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal tenderness, elevated lipase (530), and a history suggesting gallstone-related issues. A CT scan showed findings consistent with gallstone pancreatitis, and the need for ERCP was indicated. Additionally, the patient's febrile state and elevated WBC count supported the diagnosis of an ongoing inflammatory process."
