        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient presenting with 4 days of post-prandial right upper quadrant pain, alongside imaging findings from an ultrasound and CT that indicated cholelithiasis, mild pericholecystic fluid, and gallbladder wall thickening. The presence of an impacted calcified gallstone in the gallbladder neck further substantiated the diagnosis."
