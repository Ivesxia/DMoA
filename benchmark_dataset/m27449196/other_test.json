No free gas or free fluid in the abdomen. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The colon is notable for diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis. The uterus is enlarged and notable for rim calcified lesions consistent with fibroids. The base of the appendix is air-filled and normal; however, there is minimal focal fat stranding surrounding the tip of the appendix, and there is a small amount of free fluid seen in the right lower quadrant.",
