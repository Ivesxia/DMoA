                    "hepatobiliary": "The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.",

                    "adrenals": "The left adrenal gland is normal in size and shape. There is stable subcentimeter right adrenal nodule, unchanged since previous imaging and statistically likely an adenoma.",
                    "urinary": "The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is a nonobstructing 6 mm stone in the right kidney, unchanged. There is no perinephric abnormality.",

The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated up to 10 mm and fluid filled, with new surrounding mild fat stranding, and an appendicolith at its base, consistent with early uncomplicated appendicitis.",
