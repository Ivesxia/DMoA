        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of perforated cholecystitis was supported by the CT abdomen findings, which showed gallbladder wall thickening, likely perforation along the posterior margin, and adjacent fat stranding. The presence of a fluid collection communicating with the gallbladder wall also indicated a perforation."
