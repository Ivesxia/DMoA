        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, which had intermittent occurrences, and imaging findings from a CT scan that showed a dilated, fluid-filled appendix measuring 1.2 cm in diameter, consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, the absence of free air or fluid and no evidence of perforation or abscess formation was noted."
