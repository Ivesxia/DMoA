        "final_diagnosis": "Acute perforated appendicitis with peritonitis and acute abdomen",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe lower abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with adjacent mesenteric edema, supporting the diagnosis of acute perforated appendicitis. The absence of free intraperitoneal air or drainable fluid collection, along with the patient's symptoms, solidified the diagnosis."
