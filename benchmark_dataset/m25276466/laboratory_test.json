The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation with mild periportal edema and edema around the gallbladder, likely due to volume overload. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands show normal size and attenuation with no focal lesions. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. The blind-ended appendix is dilated and fluid-filled, measuring up to 8 mm, with adjacent mesenteric edema.",
