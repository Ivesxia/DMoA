        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and substernal chest pain in the context of recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and exhibited elevated lipase levels. The imaging did not show definitive biliary obstruction, but the clinical presentation and lipase elevation suggested pancreatitis possibly due to a passed CBD stone."
