        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with physical examination findings of tenderness at McBurney's point, +Rovsing's sign, and focal rebound tenderness. Additionally, CT imaging revealed a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with adjacent fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis, and there were no other significant abnormalities noted that would suggest an alternative diagnosis."
