        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis with peritoneal abscess",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, associated symptoms of subjective fevers and chills, and physical examination findings indicating right lower quadrant pain with guarding and distension. CT imaging further confirmed the diagnosis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with extensive inflammation and periappendiceal phlegmon formation."
