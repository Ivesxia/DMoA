        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute perforated appendicitis was supported by a CT scan that showed a dilated appendix measuring 13 mm and a new fluid collection adjacent to the tip of the appendix, suggesting perforation. An increase in white blood cell count from 13.4 to 21.3 also indicated an acute process."
