        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain after an ERCP procedure, and a significantly elevated lipase level over 9000 supported the diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Additionally, a CT scan revealed an 15 x 11 mm hypodense lesion in the tail of the pancreas consistent with an Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) along with mild peripancreatic stranding, indicative of post-procedural changes."
