        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by imaging findings including marked periappendiceal fat stranding, a dilated appendix measuring 15 mm, mucosal hyper-enhancement, and the presence of an appendicolith at the base of the appendix. Additionally, a small fluid collection adjacent to the appendix was noted. No other significant abdominal pathology was found that could explain the symptoms."
