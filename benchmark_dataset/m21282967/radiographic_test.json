There are no focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation. The common bile duct measures 2 mm. The gallbladder is slightly distended and filled with sludge. No discrete stones are identified. The gallbladder wall is thickened and edematous. A moderate amount of pericholecystic fluid appears similar or just slightly increased in amount.",
