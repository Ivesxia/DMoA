        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with elevated lipase levels (2731), which indicate pancreatitis. Additionally, transaminase levels were nonspecifically elevated, further suggesting a liver condition, consistent with hepatitis. The chest pain and abdominal pain, along with nausea, also supported the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
