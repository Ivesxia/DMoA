        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, fever, and hypotension, along with imaging showing a 7mm stone in the distal common bile duct and upstream dilatation of the common bile duct. These findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. The patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation also contributed to the diagnosis."
