        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypertension, Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe lower abdominal pain and back pain, which worsened over time, prompting imaging studies. Despite findings of a distended gallbladder and dilated common duct, surgery deemed no acute surgical findings. The imaging and clinical presentation, combined with the patient's history of diabetes, supported the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
