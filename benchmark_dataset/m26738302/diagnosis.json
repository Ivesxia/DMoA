        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of rapid onset abdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, along with CT findings indicating an 8 mm fluid-filled appendix with significant wall enhancement and the presence of an appendicolith, while ruling out perforation as there was no fluid collection or intraperitoneal gas."
