        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of recurrent intense epigastric pain, vomiting, inability to tolerate oral intake, and the imaging findings of gallstones with evidence of inflamed tissue in the head of the pancreas support the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. Additionally, the absence of signs indicating acute cholecystitis or other complications in the MRCP findings strengthens this conclusion."
