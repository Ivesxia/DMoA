            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "Decrease in size of the bilateral pleural effusions, residual compressive atelectasis noted in the lower lobes, normal hepatic parenchymal signal intensity without focal liver lesion, patchy region of arterial hyperenhancement at the dome of the liver, gallstones and layering sludge within the gallbladder, no evidence of acute cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis, patchy heterogeneous signal intensity within the head of the pancreas suggestive of inflamed and possibly necrotic tissue, smooth narrowing of the pancreatic duct and common bile duct without upstream dilation, less edematous pancreatic parenchyma compared to prior MRCP, substantially decreased peripancreatic edema, no pancreatic pseudocyst identified.",
            "changes_over_time": "The pancreatic parenchyma is less edematous when compared to prior MRCP and demonstrates homogeneous signal intensity and enhanced uniformly without evidence for necrosis. There is also substantially decreased amount of the peripancreatic edema and inflammatory stranding and fluid compared to prior imaging, suggesting resolving inflammation. New gastro-epiploic collaterals noted since prior imaging."
