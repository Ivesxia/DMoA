The kidneys are symmetric with a simple left renal cyst measuring 1.3 cm. The appendix is dilated at the distal tip up to 1.0 cm with fluid-filled appearance, moderate adjacent mesenteric stranding, and a mildly attenuating punctate focus consistent with appendicolith. No discrete fluid collection or extraluminal air are demonstrated. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.",
