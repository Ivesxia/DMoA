        "final_diagnosis": "Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting after eating, along with physical examination findings of tender palpation in the RUQ, which suggests cholecystitis. The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding reduces the likelihood of other acute abdominal conditions."
