        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis with gangrenous gallbladder",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe crampy epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, nausea/vomiting, and had episodes of diarrhea. The symptoms started two days prior, and the pain triggered by eating potentially precipitating foods. The severity and nature of the pain, along with the patient's medical history, led to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, suggesting a surgical resolution was deemed necessary due to the severity indicated by the gangrenous state of the gallbladder."
