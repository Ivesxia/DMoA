            "findings": "The liver is normal in echotexture, without focal lesions or biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is significantly distended, with diffuse gallbladder wall edema. There is a single 1.2 cm gallstone lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. There is no pericholecystic fluid. The common hepatic duct is normal measuring 6 mm. The right kidney measures 11.8 cm and is normal without hydronephrosis, stones or masses. There is limited visualization of the left kidney due to extensive bowel gas. A 4.0 cm cyst with thin peripheral rim of calcification is seen in upper pole of the left kidney. Two sub-centimeter echogenic foci seen in the mid portion of the left kidney, likely represent the renal stones seen in the prior CT scan. Assessment for hydronephrosis in the left kidney is limited at this time. There is no ascites. The visualized proximal abdominal aorta maximally measures 3 cm, but the distal abdominal aorta is obscured by overlying bowel gas.",
