        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute epigastric pain, which was consistent with acute cholecystitis, supported by imaging that showed gallbladder wall edema and multiple gallstones, as well as mild intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation. The clinical history of similar severe pain episodes further reinforced the diagnosis."
