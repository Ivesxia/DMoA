        "final_diagnosis": "Drug induced pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Drug induced dermatitis v viral exanthem",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of fever, cough, and chest/back pain led to imaging studies (CTA and echocardiogram) that were unremarkable. Following her discharge, she developed total body itching and a rash leading to peeling skin, alongside nausea and right-sided abdominal pain. The resolution of symptoms after administration of solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid supports a diagnosis of drug-induced reactions."
