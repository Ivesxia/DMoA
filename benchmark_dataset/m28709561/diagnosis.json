        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was supported by the presence of marked bowel wall thickening involving the cecum with associated pericecal fat stranding, an inflamed cecal diverticulum, and a small amount of fluid in the right paracolic gutter. The appendix was normal, and there was no evidence of free air or fluid to suggest more complicated conditions."
