            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "At the lung bases, there is mild dependent atelectasis, without consolidation or pleural effusion. The liver contains multiple small hepatic hypodensities, too small to characterize, but statistically represent simple cysts. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and duodenum are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis, stones, or worrisome renal masses. In the left kidney, there is a focal cortical hypodensity too small to characterize. The abdominal aorta and its major branches are normal. There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen. Right-sided diverticulosis is noted with marked bowel wall thickening involving the cecum, associated pericecal fat stranding, and an inflamed cecal diverticulum with mucosal hyperenhancement. There is a small amount of fluid in the right paracolic gutter adjacent to the appendix, which is normal in size and contains a small amount of air at the tip. Reactive lymph nodes are noted in the RLQ. The remainder of the colon demonstrates scattered diverticulosis without other foci of acute process. Small bowel is normal in caliber. There is a small amount of free fluid layering dependently in the pelvis. The urinary bladder, distal ureters, and prostate gland are unremarkable. There is no fracture or worrisome bony lesion.",
