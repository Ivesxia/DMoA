        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of sharp abdominal pain, notably in the LUQ and RUQ, and had recent ultrasound findings of multiple gallstones and a distended gallbladder with an obstructing stone. Her elevated liver function tests and previous workup for other pathologies were negative, supporting the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Surgical intervention was initiated due to the severity of symptoms and ongoing complications."
