        "final_diagnosis": "gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of epigastric and RUQ pain, nausea, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST significantly elevated), along with the presence of multiple gallstones. Imaging findings from the MRCP indicated multiple gallstones in the gallbladder with no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, which points toward pancreatitis secondary to gallstones."
