The previously noted retrocardiac opacity is now worsened, completely obliterating the left hemidiaphragm, also containing air bronchograms, consistent with consolidation or/and atelectasis. There is increase in bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right. Upper lungs are clear. No evidence of fluid overload or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contour is stable.",
