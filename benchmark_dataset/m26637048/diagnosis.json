        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and a tender abdomen, particularly worsened in the right lower quadrant with a positive psoas sign. CT imaging confirmed dilation of the appendix to 18 mm, presence of obstructive fecaliths, and surrounding fat stranding, which are characteristic findings of appendicitis."
