        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included left lower abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ with rebound tenderness and guarding. CT findings confirmed a markedly inflamed appendix with an internal appendicolith, which supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
