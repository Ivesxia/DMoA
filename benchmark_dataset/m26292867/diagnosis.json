        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, and signs consistent with diverticulitis, including wall thickening and free fluid seen on CT at the junction of the descending and sigmoid colon. The absence of free air or fluid in other abdominal regions and normal findings in surrounding organs further supported this diagnosis."
