        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of crampy abdominal pain that became sharp and localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, and chills. Imaging via CT scan confirmed an abnormal appendix that was fluid-filled with a hyperdense appendicolith and mild periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
