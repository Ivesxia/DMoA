        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of 3 days of progressive abdominal pain, particularly more severe in the lower abdomen, was supported by CT imaging findings showing a fluid-filled and borderline distended appendix with mucosal hyper-enhancement and adjacent inflammatory change. The absence of other significant abdominal abnormalities further supported the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
