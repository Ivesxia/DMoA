A single diverticulum nearby is unaffected. The appendix appears normal with a small amount of fluid at the tip, not dilated, likely representing a reactive change. The kidneys show a single hypodensity in the mid pole of the right kidney, likely representing a simple cyst. No evidence of obstruction in the small and large intestine, no lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or free air. Visualized lung bases are clear.",
