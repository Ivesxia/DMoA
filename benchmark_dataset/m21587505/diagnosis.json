        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with two days of abdominal pain localized initially to the lower quadrants, becoming diffuse, along with tenderness and guarding in the abdomen. No fever was noted, but the pain was significant and associated with vaginal discharge. The physical examination and radiological findings suggested a serious abdominal condition, leading to the diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis."
