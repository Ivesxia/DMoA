        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with post-prandial abdominal pain, nausea, and a history of cholelithiasis, which supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. An ultrasound indicated cholelithiasis without gallbladder wall thickening, corroborating the diagnosis and ruling out other acute abdominal conditions."
