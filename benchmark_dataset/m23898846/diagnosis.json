        "final_diagnosis": "acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with mid-epigastric pain and a recent evaluation that revealed gallstones. The abdominal examination showed extreme tenderness in the right upper quadrant, consistent with acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound findings confirmed multiple small gallstones, but there was no gallbladder wall edema, which is typically associated with acute cholecystitis. The persistence and worsening of pain, along with the ultrasound findings, supported the diagnosis."
