        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute kidney injury, Post op ileus",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain, especially in the RUQ, accompanied by nausea and low-grade fever. Presentation included hypotension which improved with fluid, and the abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the RUQ. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the clinical presentation and the possibility of Mirizzi syndrome due to the location of pain and history. Gangrenous cholecystitis was considered based on the severity of symptoms."
