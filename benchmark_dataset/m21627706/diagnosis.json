        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of isolated right lower quadrant abdominal pain, findings of a fluid-filled and dilated appendix, wall thickening, hyperemia, and periappendiceal fat stranding on imaging. There was no evidence of perforation, and other abdominal organs appeared normal."
