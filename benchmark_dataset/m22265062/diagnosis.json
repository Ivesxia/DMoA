        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of worsening abdominal pain in the RUQ, nausea, and inability to tolerate oral intake, which are consistent with acute cholecystitis. Physical exam findings included tenderness in the RUQ and epigastrium. The history of diarrhea might suggest a gastrointestinal process but did not provide a definitive alternative diagnosis."
