    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with migrating abdominal pain that initially started in the epigastric region and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The pain was persistent and increased in intensity, associated with nausea and intolerance to PO, but the patient denied fevers, chills, diarrhea, urinary frequency, dysuria, and other significant acute abdominal symptoms. Imaging via CT showed dilation of the appendix with multiple appendicoliths and fluid content, consistent with acute appendicitis."
