No evidence of CBD dilation with the proximal CBD measuring 4 mm and the distal CBD measuring 7 mm. Multiple tiny gallstones are seen in the fundus of the gallbladder. There is a 2 cm T2 hyperintense lesion in the caudate lobe with progressive peripheral nodular enhancement, consistent with a hemangioma. No evidence of intra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The pancreas enhances heterogeneously with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collections. Subcentimeter porta hepatis lymph nodes noted. There is a 1-cm T2 hyperintense lesion in the spleen, consistent with a hemangioma. Adrenal glands and kidneys appear normal.",
