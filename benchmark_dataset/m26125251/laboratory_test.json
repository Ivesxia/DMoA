No evidence of CBD dilation with the proximal CBD measuring 4 mm and the distal CBD measuring 7 mm. Multiple tiny gallstones are seen in the fundus of the gallbladder. In the caudate lobe, there is a 2 cm T2 hyperintense lesion demonstrating progressive peripheral nodular enhancement, consistent with a hemangioma. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collections. There is a 1-cm T2 hyperintense lesion in the spleen, consistent with a hemangioma. Adrenal glands and kidneys appear normal.",
