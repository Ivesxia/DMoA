        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right scapula, nausea, and a history of gastric bypass. Imaging revealed multiple tiny gallstones in the gallbladder and a less than 2-mm nonobstructing stone in the distal common bile duct, consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. There was no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collections."
