A low insertion of the cystic duct was noted. Multiple tiny gallstones are seen in the fundus of the gallbladder. In the caudate lobe, there is a 2 cm T2 hyperintense lesion demonstrating progressive peripheral nodular enhancement, consistent with a hemangioma. No evidence of intra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The pancreas enhances heterogeneously with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collections. There are subcentimeter porta hepatis lymph nodes. There's also a 1-cm T2 hyperintense lesion in the spleen, consistent with a hemangioma. Adrenal glands and kidneys appear normal. Visualized bowel loops are unremarkable. Bone marrow signal is normal.",
