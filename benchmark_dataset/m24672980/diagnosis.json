        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of biliary pancreatitis was supported by the patient's history of symptoms, prior procedures (ERCP), and examination findings. The presence of multiple gallstones likely contributed to the pancreatitis. Post-procedural complications such as fever were noted but did not change the primary diagnosis."
