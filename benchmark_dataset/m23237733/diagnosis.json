        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 3-day history of progressive abdominal pain localized in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), characterized by constant dull pain with intermittent sharp jolts. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ with rebound tenderness, suggestive of an acute abdominal process. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a rim enhancing fluid collection in the RLQ associated with cecal wall thickening, consistent with perforated appendicitis."
