No evidence of perforation is seen. Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. Focal hypodensity involving liver segments 4A, 4B, 6 and 8 likely reflects focal fatty deposition. Normal findings for pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, urinary bladder, and reproductive organs. No evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.",
