        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of periumbilical pain that progressed to right lower quadrant pain, associated with nausea. Imaging findings from a CT scan revealed an enlarged appendix with wall hyper-enhancement, adjacent fascial thickening, mild fat stranding, and edema, all indicative of acute appendicitis."
