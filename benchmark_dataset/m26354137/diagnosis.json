        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by imaging findings that indicated the presence of stones and sludge in the gallbladder along with an edematous gallbladder wall. Additionally, the patient presented with abdominal pain and positive urinalysis suggesting a urinary tract infection, but the primary concern was the gallbladder condition based on the imaging results."
