At the junction between the appendix and the cecum, there is a well-circumscribed dense intraluminal structure measuring 8 x 3 mm, compatible with an appendicolith. There is fat stranding surrounding this inflamed appendix. Two well-circumscribed fluid densities in the right kidney compatible with simple cysts. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis is seen in the right lower quadrant. The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appears unremarkable. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands all appear normal.",
