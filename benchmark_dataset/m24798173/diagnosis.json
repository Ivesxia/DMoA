        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, worsening over the past days, associated with subjective fevers and chills, reduced appetite, and weight loss. Past medical history of diverticulosis contributed to suspicion of diverticulitis. Examination revealed tenderness greater on the left, particularly in the upper quadrants, further supporting the diagnosis."
