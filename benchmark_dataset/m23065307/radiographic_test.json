Multiple hypoenhancing liver metastases are slightly larger than the recent prior study. The largest mass in segment VII of the liver now measures 42 x 29 mm (previously 35 x 23 mm), and a mass in segment V of the liver now measures 47 x 46 mm (previously 44 x 39 mm). The pancreas appears mildly enlarged with mild peripancreatic fat stranding. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis. An ill-defined lytic lesion in the right iliac bone is unchanged.",
