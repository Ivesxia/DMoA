        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of abdominal pain starting periumbilically and migrating to the right lower quadrant, along with physical exam findings of rebound tenderness and positive psoas and obturator signs, strongly indicated appendicitis. Imaging via CT revealed a 5 mm appendicolith and a dilated appendix measuring 9 mm, accompanied by mild periappendiceal stranding, which corroborated the diagnosis."
