    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sharp epigastric pain, elevated lipase of 400, and history of known gallstones. MRCP findings indicated diffuse edema within the retroperitoneum, supporting the diagnosis of pancreatitis, with the presence of a 10-mm gallstone in the gallbladder neck. Other gastrointestinal conditions were considered based on past medical history but were ruled out by the evidence provided."
