    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis without mention of peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, which was tender to palpation and exhibited guarding. The CT abdomen and pelvis findings revealed a hyperenhancing appendix measuring up to 15 mm with extensive surrounding inflammation, consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, there were no signs of obstruction or free air, further solidifying the diagnosis."
