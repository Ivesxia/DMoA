        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and a history of cholelithiasis. Imaging showed pericholecystic fluid and filling defects in the common bile duct, suggesting the presence of stones. The surgical team recommended ERCP for choledocholithiasis and considered early cholangitis. The diagnosis of cholecystitis was made based on clinical findings and imaging results."
