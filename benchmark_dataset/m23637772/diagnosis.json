        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pancreatitis was supported by the patient's acute midepigastric/RUQ abdominal pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), elevated lipase levels, and the presence of cholelithiasis identified on ultrasound. The history of gallstones, combined with these findings, indicated pancreatitis as the likely cause."
