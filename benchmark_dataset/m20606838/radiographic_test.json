High-density intraluminal material throughout a large portion of the proximal to mid appendix could represent fecal material versus appendicoliths. Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The liver has a 2.2 cm hypoenhancing region about the falciform ligament likely representing focal fat. Other abdominal organs appear normal.",
