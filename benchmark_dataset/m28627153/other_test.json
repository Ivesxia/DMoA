There is minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The liver is without focal lesions. A stone is identified in the gallbladder. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable. In the right kidney, there is a 1.1 cm hypodense lesion that is too small to characterize, stable in size and likely represents a cyst. Extensive diverticula are seen throughout the colon. There is minimal focal dilatation of the aorta to 2.5 cm in the infrarenal portion, unchanged. A colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant.",
