There is minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe. A stone is identified in the gallbladder. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable. In the right kidney, there is a 1.1 cm hypodense lesion that is stable in size and likely represents a cyst. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Extensive diverticula are seen throughout the colon. There is minimal focal dilatation of the aorta to 2.5 cm in the infrarenal portion, unchanged. A colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant.",
