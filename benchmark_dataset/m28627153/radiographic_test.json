            "findings": "The previously noted right small pleural effusion has resolved. There is a persistent small left pleural effusion which is not significantly changed. There is minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The liver is without focal lesions. A stone is identified in the gallbladder. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable. In the right kidney, there is a 1.1 cm hypodense lesion that is too small to characterize and is stable in size likely representing a cyst. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The small bowel is normal. Extensive diverticula are seen throughout the colon. There is minimal focal dilatation of the aorta to 2.5 cm in the infrarenal portion, unchanged. A colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant.",
            "changes_over_time": "The right small pleural effusion has resolved. The left pleural effusion is persistent but not significantly changed. A residual collection in the left lower quadrant decreased in size from 5.7 x 3.4 cm to 4.7 x 2.7 cm. A small collection in the right lower quadrant decreased in size from 3.5 x 2.2 cm to 2.8 x 2.1 cm."
