        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of diverticulitis was supported by the presence of diffuse wall thickening and extensive fat stranding surrounding a short segment of the sigmoid colon, with associated thickening of the sigmoid mesocolon, consistent with acute sigmoid inflammation. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis was also noted. There were no signs of perforation or drainable fluid collections that could suggest an abscess."
