    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, associated with nausea. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dilated appendix with a thickened, hyperemic wall, consistent with acute appendicitis. There was also mild haziness/stranding of the periappendiceal fat, which further supported the diagnosis of appendicitis with generalized peritonitis."
