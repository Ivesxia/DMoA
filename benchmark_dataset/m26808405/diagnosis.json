        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis was supported by the patient's 2-day history of abdominal pain migrating to the right side, mildly tender abdomen in the right upper quadrant, and ultrasound findings showing a large amount of sludge with echogenic shadowing stones in the gallbladder, as well as a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. No significant gallbladder wall thickening was noted, but the presence of impacted stones and the patient's symptoms were indicative."
