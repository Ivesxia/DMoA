        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain for 5-6 days, along with anorexia and nausea, which worsened and became pleuritic. Clinical examination revealed right-sided tenderness. The CT scan indicated moderate pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis, but no other significant abnormalities were noted, supporting the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
