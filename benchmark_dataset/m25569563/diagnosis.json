        "final_diagnosis": "Post-ERCP pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Community acquired pneumonia, mild anemia due to phlebotomy, dilution from IV fluids and inflammatory block due to acute pancreatitis, CAD s/p MI and stent x 2 with post-MI systolic CHF, microscopic hematuria",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including severe epigastric pain, elevated lipase levels, and the timeline of the recent ERCP procedure. Chest radiograph findings indicated left lower lobe consolidation, raising concern for pneumonia, which was noted as a differential diagnosis."
