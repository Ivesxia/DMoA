At the tip of the appendix, there is central bright signal consistent with fluid, and the appendix is dilated up to 8 mm. There is equivocal surrounding edema on fat-saturated T2-weighted images. The appendix appears diffusely bright on diffusion-weighted images. No MR evidence of appendicolith, perforation, or focal fluid collection. Visualized portions of the kidneys appear normal with no hydronephrosis. No gross uterine abnormalities; 3.0 x 2.2 cm left adnexal dermoid is similar to previous ultrasound.",
