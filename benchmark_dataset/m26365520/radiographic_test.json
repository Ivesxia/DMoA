At the tip of the appendix, central bright signal consistent with fluid, and the appendix is dilated up to 8 mm. Equivocal surrounding edema, diffusely bright on diffusion-weighted images. No evidence of appendicolith, perforation, or focal fluid collection. Visualized kidneys appear normal, no hydronephrosis. Left adnexal dermoid measuring 3.0 x 2.2 cm redemonstrated, cervix closed, no free pelvic fluid, anterior placenta normal. Small hyperintensity in T12 vertebral body likely representing a hemangioma.",
