Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) and right lower quadrant (RLQ). CT abdomen and pelvis showed a fluid-filled and dilated appendix up to approximately 1.0 cm, with an enlarged tip, indicating acute appendicitis. No other significant intra-abdominal pathology was noted."
