        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a burning sensation in the left upper quadrant, severe pain, nausea, and vomiting. Ultrasound findings showed several stones and layering sludge in a minimally distended gallbladder, along with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid but without significant wall edema. These findings, combined with the clinical presentation, supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
