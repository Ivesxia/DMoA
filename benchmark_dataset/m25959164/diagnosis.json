        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain of 24 hours duration, which was significantly different from her previous episodes of crampy abdominal pain. CT scan findings demonstrated relative distension of the appendiceal tip, measuring up to 9 to 10 mm with mucosal hyperenhancement, indicating appendicitis. No significant periappendiceal fat stranding or free fluid was present, but small amounts of fluid tracking into the pelvis were noted."
