            "findings": "Limited because of the lung bases demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion. The visualized heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The liver is homogeneous in enhancement. No focal lesion identified. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is normal without calcified gallstones. The portal vein, SMV, and splenic vein are patent. The spleen is normal. The pancreas enhances homogenously and is without focal lesions, peripancreatic fat stranding, or focal fluid collection. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys display symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast. No focal renal lesions. No hydronephrosis or hydroureter identified. No renal or proximal ureter calculi. The distal esophagus is normal without hiatal hernia. The stomach is grossly unremarkable in appearance. Fecalization is seen throughout the terminal and distal ileum due to an incompetent ileocecal valve. The small bowel is normal in caliber without wall thickening. The large bowel is normal in caliber without wall thickening, fat stranding, or focal mass lesion. Sigmoid and descending colonic diverticulosis is present without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The retrocecal appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring 8 cm with adjacent fat stranding and extraluminal air consistent with perforated appendicitis. Surrounding phlegmonous changes and fat stranding is noted. No focal fluid collection. No appendicolith. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber without aneurysmal dilatation. Mild narrowing of the celiac axis is noted with minimal poststenotic dilatation. The celiac axis, SMA, and other vessels are otherwise patent. Moderate amount of atherosclerotic calcification noted. The iliac arteries are normal in course and caliber. No evidence of thrombophlebitis. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. No free abdominal fluid, abdominal wall hernia, or pneumoperitoneum. The bladder is well distended and normal. No pelvic side-wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. No free pelvic fluid seen. Small fat containing right inguinal hernia noted. Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes are seen within the visualized thoracolumbar spine. Degenerative changes are again noted at the left femoral head/neck junction with increased sclerosis. The femoral heads are well seated within acetabulum and round in configuration. No evidence of femoral head collapse. No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy.",
