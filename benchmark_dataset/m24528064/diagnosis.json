        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of appendicitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain that began epigastrically and then became generalized with right lower quadrant tenderness. Imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast) revealed an enlarged appendix measuring 8-9 mm, with mild wall thickening and hyperemia, consistent with appendicitis. No signs of perforation were detected, and the imaging showed no bowel obstruction."
