        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain that localized to the right epigastrum, and imaging revealed 1.0 cm mucosal hyperenhancement of the appendix with periappendiceal stranding suggestive of acute appendicitis. The anatomical variant of the cecum and the position of the appendix correlated with the location of the patient's pain."
