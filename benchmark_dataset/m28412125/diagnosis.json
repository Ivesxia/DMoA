        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was based on the patient's history of abdominal pain that started above the umbilicus and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and physical examination findings of mild focal tenderness in the RLQ. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dilated appendix with a hyperemic thickened wall and periappendiceal inflammatory changes, consistent with acute appendicitis."
