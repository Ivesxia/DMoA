            "findings": "The right renal pelvis and ureter are minimally larger than on the prior study, with slightly slower egress of contrast through the ureter than on the left. Bilaterally, renal cortical thinning is unchanged and consistent with scarring, possibly from prior infection. The ostomy in the right lower quadrant is stable. A large stool-filled structure is likely a large diverticulum, showing no change in size, position, and contents since the prior study. Lumbosacral spina bifida with posterior meningocele is unchanged.",
            "changes_over_time": "The right renal pelvis and ureter are minimally larger than previously noted, with slight changes in the egress of contrast. Renal cortical thinning is unchanged. The large diverticulum and ostomy show no changes over time."
