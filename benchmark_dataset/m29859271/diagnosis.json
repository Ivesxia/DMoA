        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, along with CT findings that showed a mildly dilated appendix measuring 9 mm, with minimal hyperemia of the wall and surrounding fat stranding. The absence of other significant findings on imaging helped confirm the diagnosis."
