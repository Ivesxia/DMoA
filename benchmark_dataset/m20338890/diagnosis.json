        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain that worsened after eating, and the ultrasound findings suggested the gallbladder appeared heterogeneous and echogenic, indicating possible sludge and stones. The inability to clearly visualize the gallbladder wall and the presence of a positive sign further supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
