        "final_diagnosis": "Perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening abdominal pain that began in the umbilical region and radiated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with nausea, vomiting, and loose bowel movements. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the RLQ and mid-right tenderness, along with positive Rovsing's sign. An ultrasound revealed a tubular structure in the RLQ at the site of pain, suspicious for appendicitis. These clinical findings and imaging results supported the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
