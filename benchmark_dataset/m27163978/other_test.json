                "pleural effusions": "Trace pleural effusions are noted bilaterally.",
                "liver": "The liver enhances homogeneously without suspicious enhancing masses.",
                "biliary": "No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The gallbladder demonstrates a fluid fluid level suggestive of biliary sludge. There is no cholelithiasis or evidence of ____.",
                "pancreas": "Peripancreatic stranding, predominantly around the body of the pancreas, is consistent with known pancreatitis. There is no pancreatic duct dilatation. No peripancreatic fluid collections are seen. A 7 mm T2 hyperintensity in the neck of the pancreas likely represents a side branch IPMN. A smaller 5 mm T2 hyperintensity in the pancreatic tail is also noted.",
                "spleen": "The spleen is normal in size and signal intensity.",
                "adrenal glands": "The adrenal glands are normal in size and signal intensity.",
                "kidneys": "A 10 mm lesion in the midpole in the left kidney demonstrates central enhancement. The lesion is T1 isointense without evidence of bulk or intravoxel fat. Bilateral renal cysts are noted.",
                "gastrointestinal tract": "The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.",
