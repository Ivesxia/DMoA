The gallbladder demonstrates a fluid fluid level suggestive of biliary sludge. Peripancreatic stranding around the body of the pancreas is consistent with known pancreatitis. A 7 mm T2 hyperintensity in the neck of the pancreas likely represents a side branch IPMN. A smaller 5 mm T2 hyperintensity in the pancreatic tail is also noted. A 10 mm lesion in the midpole in the left kidney demonstrates central enhancement.",
