        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with RUQ abdominal pain, emesis, and fever. An RUQ ultrasound showed multiple gallstones within a distended gallbladder, supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. There was no evidence of gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid, which suggests that more severe complications like perforation were not present."
