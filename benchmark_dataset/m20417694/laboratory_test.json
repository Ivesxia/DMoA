There is no ascites. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CBD measures 7 mm. Multiple gallstones are seen within a distended gallbladder. There is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. Focal areas in the gallbladder wall at the fundus with ring down artifact is compatible with adenomyomatosis.

Survey views of both kidneys do not demonstrate any masses, stones or hydronephrosis. Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits.",
