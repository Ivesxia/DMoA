                "Lower Thorax": "The lung bases are clear. The heart size is normal and there is no pericardial or pleural effusion.",
                "Liver": "The liver is normal in contour and signal intensity without focal lesions.",
                "Biliary": "Mild dilatation of the left hepatic and right anterior biliary tree is stable. The common bile duct measures up to 1.0 cm, which is unchanged.",
                "Pancreas": "The pancreas is normal in size. There is some loss of signal intensity on the T1-weighted images in the uncinate process with persistent enhancement on the delayed phase images and very mildly increased T2 signal.",
                "Spleen": "The spleen is normal in size and signal intensity.",
                "Adrenal Glands": "The adrenal glands are unremarkable.",
                "Kidneys": "Multiple rounded T2 hyperintense lesions in the kidneys bilaterally consistent with simple cysts.",
                "Gastrointestinal Tract": "Status post partial gastrectomy with expected postsurgical anatomy. A small hiatal hernia is noted. A large duodenum diverticulum is unchanged.",
                "Lymph Nodes": "No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.",
                "Vasculature": "The arterial anatomy is conventional. There is no aneurysmal dilatation or flow-limiting stenosis of the visualized great vessels of the abdomen.",
                "Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures": "Multiple T2 hyperintense lesions within the mid thoracic spine consistent with hemangiomas. No osseous lesions are worrisome for infection or malignancy."
