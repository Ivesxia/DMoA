        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Duodenal diverticulum, abdominal pain",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back, associated with diaphoresis and nausea, suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pain seemed triggered by eating, and past similar episodes were reported. Imaging revealed a large duodenal diverticulum but was consistent with pancreatitis without focal lesions in the pancreas."
