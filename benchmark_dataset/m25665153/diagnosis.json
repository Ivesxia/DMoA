        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is supported by the patient's presentation of right-sided abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, along with tenderness upon palpation in that area. The CT scan showed an enlarged appendix with hyperemic walls and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with inflammation typical for appendicitis. There was no evidence of alternative gastrointestinal issues such as bowel obstruction or diverticulitis."
