The gallbladder is minimally distended, without evidence of gallstones, gallbladder wall edema, or sonographic sign. A trace amount of pericholecystic fluid is nonspecific. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the CBD measuring 6 mm. The pancreas is poorly visualized due to overlying bowel gas.",
