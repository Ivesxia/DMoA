        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of lower abdominal pain, which was sharp and worsened with movement. The abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness primarily in the left lower quadrant, rebound tenderness, and signs suggestive of a potential obstruction. Previous similar episodes of pain were reported as self-limited. The imaging findings indicated dilatation of small bowel loops and a concerning pattern suggesting obstruction, aligning with the diagnosis of diverticulitis."
