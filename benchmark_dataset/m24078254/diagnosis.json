        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's history of midepigastric pain that worsened after eating fatty foods, nausea, and vomiting. An ultrasound revealed numerous gallbladder stones, with a particularly large stone lodged in the gallbladder neck, gallbladder wall edema, and the gallbladder slightly distended, which are indicative of acute cholecystitis."
