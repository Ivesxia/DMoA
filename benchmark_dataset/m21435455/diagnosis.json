        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with chest pain and epigastric pain, elevated lipase (832) and amylase (79), and imaging revealed a large cystic mass in the pancreatic body/tail with evidence of cholelithiasis and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). These findings, along with the history of biliary obstruction and abdominal tenderness, supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
