    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Complicated perforated appendicitis with secondary abscess formation, not amenable to percutaneous drainage.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by fever and malaise. CT findings revealed a poorly defined appendix with extensive surrounding fat stranding, extraluminal gas, and an associated abscess measuring approximately 2.4 x 4.0 cm, indicating a contained perforation. This correlates with the clinical suspicion of complicated appendicitis."
