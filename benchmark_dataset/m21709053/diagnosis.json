        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset right lower quadrant pain that migrated over time, was exacerbated by movement, and was accompanied by no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms (e.g., no nausea, vomiting, or dysuria). A CT scan indicated mildly enlarged appendix with slightly thickened walls and mild mucosal hyperenhancement, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
