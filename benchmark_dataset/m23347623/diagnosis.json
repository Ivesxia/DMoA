        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was supported by the patient's 8-day history of intermittent lower abdominal pain, constipation, and the findings of focal wall thickening with surrounding stranding involving the sigmoid colon compatible with diverticulitis, as seen on CT imaging. Additional evidence included a small collection of extraluminal air and diverticulosis noted in the colon."
