        "final_diagnosis": "Pancreatitis, Cholangiocarcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, along with a past medical history of aggressive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. Imaging studies, including a CT abdomen, indicated intra-hepatic ductal dilatation, suggesting obstructive pathology likely related to cholangiocarcinoma. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings support the diagnosis of pancreatitis as well, which might be secondary to the underlying malignancy."
