        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis is supported by the patient history of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and a CT scan showing an enlarged, hyperemic appendix with surrounding stranding and a periappendiceal phlegmon/abscess. No free air was noted, but the size of the appendix and related findings were significant."
