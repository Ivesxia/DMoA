        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of 2 days of right lower quadrant pain, which initially was diffuse but migrated to the right lower quadrant and became severe. Imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast) revealed substantial right lower quadrant fat stranding and a dilated hyperemic, thickened fluid-filled tubular structure consistent with the appendix, confirming the diagnosis."
