        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by CT findings of a dilated appendix measuring up to 1.3 cm with hyperemic and thickened walls, periappendiceal stranding, and reactive mesenteric lymph nodes. No evidence of perforation or drainable fluid collection was observed, which further corroborated the diagnosis."
