The gallbladder is full with a mildly thickened wall and contains numerous shadowing stones. No stones are visualized within the common duct. The pancreatic head and neck are partially visualized and unremarkable. A possible hypoechoic lesion is suggested but could be artifactual. Background possibly due to fatty infiltration. Trace free fluid layers beneath the left lateral liver, probably within normal limits.",
