The right ovary measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm and the left ovary measures 1.8 x 1.1 x 1.4 cm. There is no free fluid. There is a tubular appearing structure in the right lower quadrant at the site of most pain which measures 8 mm in diameter, possibly blind-ending though difficult to determine, not particularly hyperemic, noncompressible, and appears to contain a 4 mm rounded echogenic structure. These findings could be consistent with an appendiceal structure with opaque appendicolith, though this is not definite.",
