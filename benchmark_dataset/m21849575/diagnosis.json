        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the history of epigastric pain, the presence of marked inflammatory stranding around the pancreas on the CT scan, and the patient's risk factors including a history of cholecystitis. There were no indications of pancreatic necrosis or hemorrhage, ruling out more severe complications."
