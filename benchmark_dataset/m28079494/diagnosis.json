        "final_diagnosis": "Pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms including intermittent abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, fever on the first day, nausea, and an episode of bloody stool, combined with a history of cholelithiasis. Ultrasound findings included numerous gallstones, with no biliary duct dilatation or obvious signs of obstruction, but the visualisation of the pancreas was obscured by bowel gas. The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest pancreatitis may be related to the gallbladder stones."
