        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and specific physical exam findings including focal tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and a positive psoas sign. Imaging findings from the CT abdomen and pelvis confirmed a mildly hyperemic and fluid-filled appendix, slightly enlarged with accompanying minimal fat stranding."
