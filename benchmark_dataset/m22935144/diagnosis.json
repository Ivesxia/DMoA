        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the clinical presentation of abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), tenderness upon palpation in the RLQ, and positive obturator/psoas signs. CT imaging revealed a fluid-filled appendix with wall hyperenhancement and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis."
