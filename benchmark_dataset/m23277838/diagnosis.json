        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included approximately 8 hours of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain that is new and different from his existing history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a retrocecal appendix measuring up to 7 mm with mild periappendiceal fat stranding, suggesting early appendicitis, without any signs of perforation or abscess."
