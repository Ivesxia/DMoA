        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric abdominal pain that worsened with eating, similar to previous episodes associated with his gastric ulcer history. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities of the pancreas, but acute pancreatitis was still considered based on the clinical presentation, despite the imaging findings being normal."
