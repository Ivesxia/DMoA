        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is supported by the findings of the CT scan, which showed a distended gallbladder with wall thickening, mural edema, and surrounding fat stranding, indicating inflammation. The patient's clinical presentation of RUQ pain for 5 days also aligns with the diagnosis."
