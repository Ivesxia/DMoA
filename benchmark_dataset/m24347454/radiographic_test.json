The apparent wall thickening is most likely due to the collapsed state of the gallbladder. There is no pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct measures 5 mm. The liver is normal in shape and contour with normal echogenicity. There are no focal hepatic masses, the portal vein is patent, and there is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The pancreas is not well evaluated due to overlying bowel gas. The spleen is normal, measuring 11.9 cm. Bilateral kidneys are unremarkable without evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses, or renal stones. The left kidney measures 10.5 cm, and the right kidney measures 12.5 cm.",
