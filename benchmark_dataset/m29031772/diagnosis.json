        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain, worsening with food intake, along with nausea and a change in bowel habits typical of previous flares of his underlying disease. His symptoms improved after abstaining from food, which aligns with the typical presentation of acute pancreatitis. Additional findings from the abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver echogenicity and no complications related to the gallbladder, supporting the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis over other conditions."
