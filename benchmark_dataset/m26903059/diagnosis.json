        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, a history of alcohol consumption, and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis. The constant dull pain radiating to the back and lack of significant findings in liver and gallbladder suggest pancreatitis as a primary diagnosis. Additionally, the patient has a productive cough, leading to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Bradycardia was noted on physical examination with a heart rate of 50."
