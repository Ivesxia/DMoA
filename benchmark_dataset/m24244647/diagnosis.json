        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis with microperforation is supported by the CT findings of fat stranding and thickening of the sigmoid colon, as well as the presence of multiple diverticuli. These imaging characteristics, alongside the patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain and focal tenderness in the lower quadrants, led to the final diagnosis."
