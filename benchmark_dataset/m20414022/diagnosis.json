        "final_diagnosis": "Acute non-perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dilated appendix measuring up to 14 mm in diameter with intramural fluid and discernible mural enhancement, which supports the diagnosis of acute non-perforated appendicitis. Additionally, findings of mild peritoneal enhancement suggest peritoneal irritation, consistent with appendicitis."
