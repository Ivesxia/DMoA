        "final_diagnosis": "perforated appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain that started 36 hours prior and worsened compared to post-operative pain. Previous similar abdominal pain was attributed to mild appendiceal inflammation, but current symptoms suggested perforation. Diagnostic imaging revealed no air under the diaphragm, indicating no free air in the abdomen, and the patient's clinical presentation of RLQ pain and nausea were consistent with the diagnosis."
