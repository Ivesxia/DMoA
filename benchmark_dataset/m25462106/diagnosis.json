        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of abdominal pain that began around the umbilicus and radiated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with the presence of tenderness to palpation and voluntary guarding over the RLQ. The CT scan findings revealed a dilated, fluid-filled appendix measuring 8 mm with surrounding fat stranding and an appendicolith, which are indicative of appendicitis."
