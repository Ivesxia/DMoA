        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis was supported by the presence of a large rounded focus of inflammatory change with mesenteric fat stranding in the right lower quadrant, along with cecal wall thickening adjacent to this inflammatory area. The imaging findings included a tract of contrast from the anterior cecal wall and no signs of appendicitis, as the appendix was normal in size. These findings correlated with the patientâ€™s symptoms of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant."
