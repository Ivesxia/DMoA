The kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically. There is a small simple cyst within the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 1 cm and a 1.3-cm cortically based cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney. A focus of inflammatory change with mesenteric fat stranding in the right lower quadrant measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.1 cm is present anterior to the cecum. There is segmental and asymmetric cecal wall thickening adjacent to this inflammatory change. No hydronephrosis, hydroureter, free fluid, or free air is present.",
