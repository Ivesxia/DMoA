    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain for 10 hours, mild abdominal distension, and tenderness in the RLQ. The absence of fevers and chills alongside nausea suggested an acute abdominal condition. The patient's history of a large hiatal hernia was noted but was likely not related to the current acute presentation, leading to the conclusion of acute appendicitis."
