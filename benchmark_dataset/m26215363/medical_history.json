She had similar pain a month ago that resolved after about an hour and a half. The pain did not improve with viscous lidocaine and Maalox. Last night, she experienced food getting stuck in her gastric band after eating steak, which was likely too much. She had emesis once and took 800 mg of Motrin last night but has not felt nauseated since. She had a bowel movement today and denies any bright red blood per rectum, melena, diarrhea, fever, chills, or night sweats.",
