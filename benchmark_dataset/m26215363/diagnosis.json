        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of epigastric pain, which was severe and radiated to the mid chest. Past medical history included previous issues with the gastric band, but the current symptoms aligned with acute cholecystitis. The diagnostic imaging showed an appropriately positioned gastric band and no obstruction, thus ruling out other potential causes related to the band."
