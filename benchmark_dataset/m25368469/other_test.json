            "findings": "There is a small right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is a moderate hiatal hernia. The signal intensity and morphology of the liver is normal and homogeneous. There is minimal homogeneous loss of signal intensity on the in phase echo sequence. Portal and hepatic veins are patent. There are no concerning liver lesions. Mild pericholecystic hyperemia in the liver portal venous phase. Fluid-sludge level in the gallbladder with no gallstones. Asymmetric gallbladder wall edema around the hepatic edge with mild enhancement. The pancreas has a normal signal intensity and morphology, with a normal caliber pancreatic duct. Identification of new cystic lesions adjacent to the main pancreatic duct.",
            "changes_over_time": "These cysts are mostly new since the last imaging, though in retrospect, there may have been a small cystic lesion at the pancreatic head/neck junction previously."
