Adrenal Glands: Lipid rich benign 2.5 cm left adrenal adenoma. Right adrenal gland is normal. Kidneys: Multiple small bright T2 lesions in bilateral kidneys, consistent with benign cysts. 2 cm dark T2, intermediate T1 signal exophytic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney, with minimal linear peripheral discontinuous enhancement, consistent with hemorrhagic cyst.
