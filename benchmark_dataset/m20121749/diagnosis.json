        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive, unremitting right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and a history of less severe post-prandial pain suggestive of gallbladder issues. An ultrasound revealed a non-mobile stone in the gallbladder neck, thickened gallbladder wall, and no evidence of focal liver lesions or biliary ductal dilatation, supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
