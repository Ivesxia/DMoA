        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis, constipation, cholangitis, portal vein thrombus",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain related to a newly diagnosed locally metastatic pancreatic cancer. A CT scan revealed a pancreatic head mass with biliary obstruction, and brushings from a prior procedure were positive for malignant cells. Despite symptom management, complications such as constipation and cholangitis were also considered but were secondary to the primary diagnosis of pancreatic cancer."
