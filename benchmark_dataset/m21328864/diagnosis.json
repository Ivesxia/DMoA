        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by imaging findings of a dilated appendix measuring up to 13 mm with significant fat stranding at the tip and suspicion of an appendicolith that is now extraluminal. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic abdominal pain that worsened in the days leading to the evaluation supported the diagnosis."
