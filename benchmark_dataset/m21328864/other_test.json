            "findings": "There is a 5 mm peripheral nodule in the left lower lobe (unchanged from prior). The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation throughout, with diffuse hypodensity compatible with hepatic steatosis. A dilated appendix measuring up to 13 mm, with significant fat stranding at the tip, and a punctate calcification possibly representing an appendicolith. Multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes observed, some of which have increased in size most recently.",
            "changes_over_time": "The lateral caval lymph node measures 2.8 x 3.0 cm (previously 3.6 x 2.2 cm), while a left upper quadrant lymph node decreased from 1.8 x 3.1 cm to 1.6 x 2.4 cm, and a right lower quadrant node decreased from 1.1 x 1.5 cm to 0.7 x 1.3 cm."
