        "final_diagnosis": "Diverticulitis; Left frontal lobe lesion",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of diverticulitis is suggested by the patient presenting with fever, chills, and diarrhea, alongside neck pain. The left frontal lobe lesion was characterized as having increased FLAIR signal and T2 signal, with a cystic component noted on MRI. The functional imaging indicated that the lesion was in proximity to motor activation areas, which may relate to the patient's symptoms. No specific tumoral spectrum was identified, and the MRI findings indicated sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease."
