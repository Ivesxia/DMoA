Very faint enhancement just medial to the cystic component. Several scattered FLAIR hyperintense foci in the subcortical white matter suggest sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Major intracranial arteries and venous sinuses appear patent. Decreased relative cerebral blood volume in the left frontal abnormality. No significant hyperperfusion noted on the ASL sequence. MR spectroscopy shows uniformly decreased NAA in the adjacent area of FLAIR signal abnormality, no definite tumoral spectrum, choline and creatinine peaks are roughly the same in the abnormal and normal areas.",
