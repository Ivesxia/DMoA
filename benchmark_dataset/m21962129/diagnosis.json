        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis was supported by CT imaging findings, including cecal wall thickening and pericecal fat stranding, along with the presence of an approximately 2 cm tubular structure likely representing a perforated diverticulum. These findings favored cecal diverticulitis over acute appendicitis."
