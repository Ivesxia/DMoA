        "differential_diagnosis": "Umbilical hernia, Urinary retention",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with prolonged symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, particularly localized to the epigastric region, suggestive of acute cholecystitis. The vomiting became bilious, which is characteristic of bile involved in the digestive process, indicating possible gallbladder inflammation. The patient's medical history and lack of food intake contributing to these symptoms further supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
