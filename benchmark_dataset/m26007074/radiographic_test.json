A hypodensity in the interpolar region of the right kidney is too small to characterize and may reflect a cyst. Additional hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney is also incompletely characterized. There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, with a focal area of wall thickening involving a segment of the sigmoid colon measuring approximately 5 cm. Associated sigmoid inflammatory stranding, fluid along the perisigmoid fascia, and two tiny locules of air indicating local microperforation are present. No drainable fluid collection or gross free air. A small amount of fluid tracks along the right paracolic gutter. The appendix is normal.",
