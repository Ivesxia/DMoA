        "final_diagnosis": "Acute gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis was supported by a clinical history of worsening generalized pruritus, weight loss, mid-abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after eating. Additionally, laboratory findings indicated elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, alongside imaging suggesting potential biliary obstruction. The recent total knee replacement and post-operative acute blood loss anemia were relevant, but primary concern focused on gallstone-related pancreatic inflammation."
