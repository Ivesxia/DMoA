        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and physical examination findings demonstrating significant tenderness in the RLQ. Additionally, the CT scan showed an abnormal appendix with a hyperemic wall, dilation to 11mm, and inflammatory stranding in the adjacent fat, further corroborating the diagnosis."
