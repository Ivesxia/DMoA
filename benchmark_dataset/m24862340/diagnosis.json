        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced diffuse dull periumbilical discomfort that gradually progressed to sharp focal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. Physical examination showed RLQ tenderness with positive Rovsing's sign and Psoas sign, indicating appendicitis. Lab tests such as PCR for Neisseria Gonorrhoeae were negative, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis without complications."
