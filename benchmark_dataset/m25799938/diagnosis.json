        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented for elective ERCP following a recent laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy with persistent bile leak. Post-procedure, she developed mild to moderate dull abdominal pain but denied other significant symptoms, and no abnormal findings were noted on abdominal radiographs. The clinical context of the recent ERCP and symptoms is consistent with post-ERCP pancreatitis."
