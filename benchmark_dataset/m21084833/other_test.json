Within segment V of the liver, there is a 12 mm lesion identified which demonstrates arterial hyperenhancement on the arterial phase of imaging and becomes isointense to liver on more delayed phases of imaging. It does not demonstrate a correlate on either T1- or T2-weighted imaging. Findings are consistent either with a region of focal nodular hyperplasia or other benign entity within the liver. Sludge and gallstones are noted within the gallbladder which demonstrates mild gallbladder wall edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis. There is no central intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct tapers normally without evidence for choledocholithiasis.",
