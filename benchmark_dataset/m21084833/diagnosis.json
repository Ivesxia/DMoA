        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right upper quadrant pain, imaging findings of sludge and gallstones in the gallbladder with mild wall edema, and a prior episode of similar pain. The absence of biliary duct dilation and other complications also contributed to the confirmation of the diagnosis."
