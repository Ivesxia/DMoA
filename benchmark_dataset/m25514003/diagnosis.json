        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-month history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain associated with fatty food intake, and imaging studies (US and CT) showed gallstones. Laboratory tests did not indicate acute infection or common bile duct stones. The clinical context of post-gastric band complications and symptoms led to the diagnosis of cholecystitis."
