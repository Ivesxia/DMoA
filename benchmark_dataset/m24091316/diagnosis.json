        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back after lunch, which is consistent with gallstone-related issues. Episodes of milder pain in the past suggest a recurrent condition related to gallstones, and the lack of nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills also supports this diagnosis."
