Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver are too small to characterize by CT but appear unchanged from prior. A 3 mm hypodensity in the lower pole of the left kidney which is too small to characterize but statistically likely represents a cyst. Hyperdense fluid extending from the right pericolic gutter adjacent to the surgical site into the pelvis compatible with hemoperitoneum. Nonhemorrhagic free fluid is seen in the upper abdomen. There is fluid within the left anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous tissues and stranding at the umbilicus likely postsurgical.",
