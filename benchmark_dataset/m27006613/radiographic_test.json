The liver enhances homogeneously without evidence of concerning focal lesion. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The pancreas enhances homogeneously. There is no splenomegaly or focal splenic lesion. The kidneys enhance normally and symmetrically. In the right lower quadrant arising from the cecum is a fluid-filled, tubular blind-ending structure measuring up to 11 mm in diameter with adjacent fat stranding and thickening of the lateral conal fascia, consistent with acute appendicitis. There is no evidence of periappendiceal abscess or appendiceal rupture.",
