        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that began in the periumbilical region and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Physical examination showed mild tenderness in the RLQ with positive Rovsing's sign, and imaging confirmed a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with mucosal hyperemia and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis."
