        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with elevated lipase (greater than 22,000), elevated bilirubin (2.7), AST (71), and ALT (102). An ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and common bile duct dilatation, which indicates obstruction likely due to gallstones. The patient also exhibited signs of inflammation, reflected in the elevated white blood cell count (16.3)."
