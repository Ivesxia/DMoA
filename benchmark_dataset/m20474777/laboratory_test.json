            "findings": "The post contrast images are limited by patient motion. The liver is normal in morphology and signal intensity. No focal liver lesion is identified. The biliary tree is normal without intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilation. Multiple layering stones are seen within the gallbladder. Gallbladder wall edema is nonspecific in the setting of mild intra-abdominal ascites. No filling defect is seen within the cystic duct or common bile duct. The pancreas demonstrates normal signal intensity and enhancement. There is a small amount of peripancreatic stranding, but no peripancreatic fluid collection. The pancreas enhances homogenously although the post contrast images are limited by patient motion. The pancreatic duct is normal in caliber. No focal pancreatic lesion is identified. The spleen is normal. An accessory spleen is noted. The right adrenal gland is normal. Left adrenal gland has a pancake configuration. The left kidney is malrotated and lies within the midline with the right kidney in a normal anatomic position, representing an asymmetrically lying horseshoe kidney or a variant of crossed fused renal ectopia. There is no hydronephrosis. No renal lesion is identified. Visualized bowel is unremarkable. There is small intra-abdominal ascites. The imaged abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. The main portal vein and splenic vein are patent. The uterus is incompletely imaged, but is enlarged compatible with postpartum state. No concerning osseous abnormality is identified. There is diffuse body wall edema.",
