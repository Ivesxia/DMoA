            "findings": "The liver is normal in morphology and signal intensity. No focal liver lesion is identified. The biliary tree is normal without intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilation. Multiple layering stones are seen within the gallbladder. Gallbladder wall edema is nonspecific in the setting of mild intra-abdominal ascites. The pancreas demonstrates normal signal intensity and enhancement. There is a small amount of peripancreatic stranding, but no peripancreatic fluid collection. The pancreas enhances homogenously. The pancreatic duct is normal in caliber. No focal pancreatic lesion is identified. The spleen is normal with an accessory spleen noted. The right adrenal gland is normal. The left adrenal gland has a pancake configuration. The left kidney is malrotated in midline, with the right kidney in a normal position, suggesting a horseshoe kidney or crossed fused renal ectopia. There is no hydronephrosis and no renal lesion identified. Visualized bowel is unremarkable with small intra-abdominal ascites. The uterus is incompletely imaged but is enlarged compatible with the postpartum state. No concerning osseous abnormality is identified. There is diffuse body wall edema.",
