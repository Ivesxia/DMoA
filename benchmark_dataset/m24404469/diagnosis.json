        "final_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis with biliary ductal obstruction",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is supported by significantly elevated lipase levels (lipase of 2345) and abdominal pain associated with biliary ductal obstruction as indicated by CT scan findings of intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The patient's history of a mechanical fall and subsequent abdominal symptoms further correlates with the diagnosis."
