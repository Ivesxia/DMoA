        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 18 hours of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and physical exam findings including tenderness in the right lower quadrant, positive Rovsing's sign, and no rebound or guarding. These clinical features, along with the patient's history and symptoms, supported the diagnosis of appendicitis, leading to the decision for laparoscopic appendectomy which was converted to open appendectomy."
