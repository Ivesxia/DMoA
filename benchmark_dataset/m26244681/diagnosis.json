        "differential_diagnosis": "Coronary artery disease, lung mass",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis, including elevated lipase levels (1485) and acute renal failure (Cre of 6.2). Differential diagnoses included coronary artery disease and a lung mass, both significant due to the patient's history of CAD and recent STEMI. Imaging revealed a large mass in the right upper lobe and multiple nodules, indicating the presence of a lung mass."
