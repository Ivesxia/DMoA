        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated appendicitis was supported by CT imaging findings of a dilated and fluid-filled appendix measuring 10 mm, with mucosal hyperenhancement and surrounding fat stranding/fluid, indicating inflammation. Additionally, the absence of appendicolith and bowel obstruction further reinforced this diagnosis."
