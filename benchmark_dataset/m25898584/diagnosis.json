        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, and was noted to have a history of diverticulosis. The imaging findings showed dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of a developing small bowel ileus, and the absence of free intraperitoneal air was noted, however, based on the clinical presentation, perforated appendicitis was determined to be the final diagnosis."
