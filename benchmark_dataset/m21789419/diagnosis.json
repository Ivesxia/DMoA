        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 2 days post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ultrasound showed moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation and mild dilation of the proximal pancreatic duct, consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No evidence of biliary obstruction was found, ruling out the need for further intervention."
