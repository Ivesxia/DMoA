        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain that began with periumbilical burning sensation and radiated to the right lower quadrant. Physical examination revealed mild right lower quadrant tenderness and some guarding, which are consistent with acute appendicitis. Additionally, there were no signs of fever or diarrhea, which may further support the diagnosis."
