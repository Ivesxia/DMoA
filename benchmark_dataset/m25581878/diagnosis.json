        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after a recent ERCP. Imaging revealed a migration of the pancreatic duct stent, which indicated possible complications related to gallstones affecting the pancreas. The presence of respiratory abnormalities and bilateral pleural effusions were noted but not crucial to the primary diagnosis."
