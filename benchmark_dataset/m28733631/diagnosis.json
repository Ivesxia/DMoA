        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the LUQ and RUQ, associated with nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound findings revealed a markedly distended gallbladder with multiple shadowing gallstones, mild gallbladder wall thickening, and positive sonographic Murphy's sign, which are indicative of acute cholecystitis."
