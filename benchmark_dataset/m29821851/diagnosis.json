        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT findings indicated a large area of inflammation centered around a dilated tubular structure, consistent with perforated appendicitis, along with fat stranding and a peripherally enhancing septated collection. This is corroborated by the patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, and clinical signs such as positive McBurney's and Psoas signs."
