        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cholecystitis is supported by the patient's RUQ pain that worsened after eating, the presence of a 2 cm immobile stone in the gallbladder neck, gallbladder distension with a thickened wall, trace pericholecystic fluid, and tenderness during the physical exam. The patient's subjective fever, chills, nausea, and the ultrasound findings indicating inflamed pericholecystic fat also support the diagnosis."
