        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of diffuse abdominal pain that localizes to the right lower quadrant, along with tenderness in that area, suggests acute appendicitis. Ultrasound findings show a non-compressible blind-ending tubular structure with mild wall hyperemia and adjacent free fluid, indicating inflammation consistent with appendicitis."
