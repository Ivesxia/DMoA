        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, which was constant and accompanied by nausea but no vomiting. The history of recent alcohol consumption and the clinical presentation are consistent with pancreatitis. The ultrasound findings indicated normal echotexture of the liver and gallbladder, while the body of the pancreas appeared normal, yet the distal pancreatic tail was obscured, which may suggest underlying inflammatory changes typical of pancreatitis."
