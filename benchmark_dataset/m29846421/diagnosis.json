        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of acute-onset lower abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and chills. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant and suprapubic area with guarding and rebound tenderness. Imaging via CT abdomen and pelvis showed the appendix was normal in size with mild mucosal hyperenhancement, and no signs of complications such as perforation or peritonitis."
