There is a small amount of slightly more organized fluid in the pancreaticoduodenal groove, indicating acute pancreatitis. No appreciable areas of necrosis. Multiple gallstones are present, with no evidence of stones in the common bile duct. The liver shows atrophy and nodular contour suggesting changes of fibrosis/cirrhosis. The spleen is enlarged, with suggestion of perigastric varices. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.",
