        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone Pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, specifically localized in the RUQ and epigastric region, associated with vomiting, which aligns with gallstone pancreatitis. Radiological findings from the MRCP indicated the presence of numerous gallstones and mildly increased signal of the peripancreatic fat, supporting the diagnosis of pancreatitis. No signs of acute cholecystitis were noted, which ruled it out as the primary concern."
