            "findings": "Numerous gallstones within the gallbladder, no signs of acute cholecystitis. Biliary tree and pancreatic duct normal in caliber without filling defects. Mildly increased T2-weighted signal noted of the peripancreatic fat. Several tiny cystic lesions in the pancreas measuring up to 5 mm with no enhancement. Slight decrease in signal intensity of the hepatic parenchyma on pre-contrast T1-weighted images relative to in-phase images indicating fatty infiltration. Tiny simple cyst in the right hepatic lobe. Numerous bilateral parapelvic cysts and small bilateral simple cortical renal cysts. The largest cortical cyst is at the right upper pole measuring 13 mm. Unremarkable spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel. A 16-mm well-circumscribed round lesion of the wall of the descending colon consistent with lipoma. Incidental findings include focal ectasia of the infrarenal aorta and circumaortic left renal vein. Degenerative changes of the spine noted.",
