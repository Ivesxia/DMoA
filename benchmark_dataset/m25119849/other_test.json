            "findings": "There is a tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in segment 7 of the liver, too small to fully characterize but likely a biliary hamartoma or hepatic cyst. There is fluid-filled dilatation of the appendix with wall thickening, measuring up to 1.2 cm, and adjacent mild fat stranding, compatible with appendicitis. Several appendicoliths are noted in proximal appendix. No evidence of perforation or abscess formation.",
