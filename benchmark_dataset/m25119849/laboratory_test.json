Tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in segment 7 of the liver, too small to fully characterize but likely a biliary hamartoma or hepatic cyst. Normal pancreas without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Normal spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum. Fluid-filled dilatation of the appendix with wall thickening measuring up to 1.2 cm, adjacent mild fat stranding compatible with acute appendicitis. Several appendicoliths noted in proximal appendix.
