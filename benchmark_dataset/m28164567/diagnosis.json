        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's acute onset of abdominal pain localized in the lower quadrants, alongside imaging findings of a dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding and cecal thickening on CT. The absence of free air, fluid collection, or significant bowel abnormalities further supported the diagnosis."
