        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT abdomen with contrast revealed inflammation centered around the posterior cecum with multiple diverticula, including one with hyperdense contents. The appendix showed signs of inflammation adjacent to this area, but the primary inflammatory changes were located posterior to the appendix, supporting the diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis."
