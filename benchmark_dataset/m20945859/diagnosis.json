        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening abdominal pain, particularly in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), nausea, vomiting, chills, and loose bowel movements, suggestive of an abdominal process. The CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a distended appendix measuring 11 cm with fluid and enhancing wall, indicating inflammation and perforation. Accompanying findings included free fluid in the pelvis and focal wall thickening of distal ileum, supporting the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
