        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic cholecystitis, Obesity",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with a history of gallstones. Imaging showed cholelithiasis, and the symptoms of abdominal pain worsening after dietary indiscretions suggested gallstone-related issues. The presence of rebound tenderness in the abdominal exam further supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
