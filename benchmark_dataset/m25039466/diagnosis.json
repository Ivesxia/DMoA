        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a 1-week history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, diagnosed with cholelithiasis via RUQ ultrasound. Despite some nausea, she denied fever, chills, vomiting, or diarrhea. The ultrasound findings indicated the presence of numerous echogenic stones within the gallbladder with a typical wall echo shadow, but there was no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The clinical presentation and imaging findings supported the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
