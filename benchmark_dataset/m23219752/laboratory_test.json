The pancreatic head and neck are within normal limits. A single view of the right kidney shows no hydronephrosis. Multiple small stones and possibly polyps are seen within the gallbladder. Additionally, there is gallbladder distension, wall edema (9mm), minimal pericholecystic fluid, and a positive sonographic sign. The common bile duct measures 4 mm and is not dilated.",
