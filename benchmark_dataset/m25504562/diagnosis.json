        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and imaging findings of an enlarged appendix with wall thickening and hyperenhancement. The absence of other serious abdominal pathology in the CT findings further confirmed the diagnosis."
