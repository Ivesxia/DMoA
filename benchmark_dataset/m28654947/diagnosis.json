        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset abdominal pain that migrated to the right flank/right lower quadrant (RLQ) and was associated with anorexia and subjective fevers. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dilated appendix with evidence of periappendiceal fat stranding and a calcified structure compatible with appendicolith, indicating acute appendicitis."
