The adrenal glands are normal in size and configuration bilaterally. Kidneys demonstrate no signs of hydronephrosis or stone. No hydroureter or evidence of ureteral stone. The abdominal aorta appears normal in caliber and course. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The stomach and duodenum appear normal. No free air or free fluid. Loops of small bowel demonstrate no evidence of ileus or obstruction. There is a calcified structure within the mid body of the appendix compatible with appendicolith. Distal to this point, the appendix is dilated and there is significant periappendiceal fat stranding, compatible with acute appendicitis. Appendix is retrocecal. Presence of early phlegmonous change could indicate microperforation. The large bowel is unremarkable aside from the presence of scattered diverticula. The urinary bladder has a collapsed appearance. Prostate calcifications are present. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy in the deep pelvis. Fat-containing bilateral inguinal hernias are present. No worrisome osseous lesions are present.",
