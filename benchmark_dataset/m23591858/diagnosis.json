        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's presenting symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, findings of a distended gallbladder with wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, and several gallstones noted on MRCP. The dilated common bile duct and the focal signal void in the cystic duct suggesting obstruction also contributed to this diagnosis."
