        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe bilateral upper epigastric pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and changes in bowel movements. Past episodes of similar pain had resolved spontaneously, but this episode was markedly more severe, necessitating surgical intervention. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, which is indicated for acute cholecystitis."
