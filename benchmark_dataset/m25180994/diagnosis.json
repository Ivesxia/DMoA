        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated cholecystitis was supported by imaging findings, including a distended gallbladder with multiple areas of wall discontinuity, extravasation of gallbladder fluid, and the presence of gallstones. There were also signs of inflammatory changes and the formation of an intrahepatic abscess, indicating severe inflammatory processes associated with a perforated gallbladder."
