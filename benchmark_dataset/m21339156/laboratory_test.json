A small amount of extraluminal air and extraluminal fluid indicate focal perforation. The fluid collection measures 1.1 x 1.5 x 2.6 cm. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis, stones, or renal masses. At the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is a 2.1 cm hypodensity with intermediate attenuation characteristics.",
