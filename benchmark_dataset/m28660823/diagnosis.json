        "final_diagnosis": "acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by findings from an MRCP, which showed a distended gallbladder with wall edema, thickening, and layered biliary sludge, as well as calculi at the gallbladder neck and within the proximal cystic duct. The patient's presenting symptoms of new onset right upper quadrant pain and nausea/vomiting further align with this diagnosis."
