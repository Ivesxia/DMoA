            "findings": "The gallbladder is distended with gallbladder wall edema and thickening. There is layered biliary sludge within the gallbladder with calculi noted at the gallbladder neck and within the proximal cystic duct. No filling defects are identified within the common bile duct. Periportal edema is noted within the liver. There is arterial phase hyperenhancement surrounding the gallbladder consistent with transient perfusion. There are two subcentimeter T2 hyperintense cystic lesions in segment VIII of the liver likely representing subcentimeter biliary hamartomas. There is a 3.9 x 3.4-cm saccular aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Multiple T2 hyperintense lesions are noted throughout the spleen, consistent with multiple hemangiomas. The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13.8 cm in length. There are simple cysts within both kidneys. The pancreas is otherwise unremarkable. Atelectasis is noted within both lung bases, more marked on the right than the left.",
