Common duct normal caliber. Gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear normal. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A subcentimeter probable cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney is unchanged. Moderate atherosclerotic disease present along the aorta. Inflammation extending inferomedially from the cecal tip into the pelvis, with multiple small locules of extraluminal air, suggestive of complicated appendicitis with contained perforation. Inflammatory fat stranding and phlegmonous change noted, without discrete fluid collection. Mild presacral stranding redemonstrated. Small amount of low-density fluid within the deep pelvis decreased in amount compared to prior, likely representing residual hematoma/seroma. No focal concerning lesion in bone window. Mild multilevel spondylosis in thoracic and lumbar spine.",
