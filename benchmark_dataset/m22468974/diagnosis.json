        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of diverticulitis was supported by imaging findings of a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm hypoattenuating, rim-enhancing lesion in the descending colon with adjacent pericolonic fat stranding and fascial thickening. This was consistent with inflammation and abscess formation, indicative of diverticulitis."
