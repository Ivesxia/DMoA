        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's sudden onset of right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, which radiated to the lower back, along with nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound findings indicated the presence of an intimal wall stone lodged in the neck of the gallbladder, trace gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid, which are consistent with acute cholecystitis."
