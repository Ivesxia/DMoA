        "final_diagnosis": "Cholecystitis with history of common bile duct obstruction.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with signs of acute abdominal distress, including RUQ pain radiating to the epigastrium, subjective fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) raised concern for possible choledocholithiasis. An ultrasound revealed multiple mobile gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, and a non-distended gallbladder, supporting the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Additionally, the common bile duct was not dilated, indicating that any obstruction may have been historical in nature."
