    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute on chronic cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presents with recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, which have been intermittent for at least a year, and acute symptoms starting 30 minutes after eating. The ultrasound findings show no evidence of gallstones or wall thickening, but a positive sonographic Murphy's sign indicates gallbladder inflammation, supporting the diagnosis of acute on chronic cholecystitis."
