            "findings": "A 4 mm T2 hyperintense nonenhancing lesion in segment 2 of the liver and a 1.5 cm segment 4 lesion with similar MRI characteristics are consistent with biliary hamartomas/cysts. The liver demonstrates normal morphology and signal intensity with no demonstrable steatosis. No concerning focal liver lesion identified. Trace perihepatic ascites. Gallbladder is mildly distended and demonstrates marked gallbladder wall edema. Small gallstones were better seen on prior ultrasound study. No evidence of choledocholithiasis. The pancreas has T2 hyperintense nonenhancing lesions likely representing side-branch IPMNs. Renal cysts bilaterally with the largest being a 12 mm left upper pole cyst.",
