        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of abdominal pain radiating to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), progressive worsening over 24 hours, and imaging findings of a 14 mm dilated tubular structure in the RLQ with a hyperdensity suggestive of appendicolith. No evidence of free fluid or free air was present, indicating uncomplicated appendicitis."
