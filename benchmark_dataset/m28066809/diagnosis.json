        "final_diagnosis": "acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of upper abdominal pain radiating to the left shoulder, coupled with nausea/vomiting and ultrasound findings of a distended gallbladder with wall thickening and impacted stones, supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The presence of pericholecystic fluid and the inability to exclude gallbladder perforation further corroborate this diagnosis."
