The gallbladder is distended, demonstrating diffuse wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. Two large impacted stones are seen at the gallbladder neck, estimated just over 1 cm in size. An additional stone is also seen in the fundus. Gallbladder perforation cannot be excluded given adjacent fluid and somewhat relaxed distention of the gallbladder. Portal vein demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow.",
