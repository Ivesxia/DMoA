        "differential_diagnosis": "post-op hyperglycemia, post-op delirium, post-op blood loss anemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis with necrotizing pancreatitis was supported by the patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, elevated levels of amylase and lipase, and CT findings of pancreatic enlargement with surrounding inflammation and multiple gallstones. The elevated WBC count and subsequent trends during hospitalization also contributed to the diagnosis."
