        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of epigastric pain radiating to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), nausea, and vomiting. The CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed diffuse inflammation of the appendix, mural hyperemia, and subjacent fat stranding, with the appendix measuring up to 7 mm in diameter, consistent with appendicitis. There were no findings indicative of free air or periappendiceal abscess, and other abdominal organs remained unremarkable."
