There is a hyperechoic focus in the right lobe measuring 1.4 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm, a probable small hemangioma. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. Multiple shadowing gallstones are identified within the gallbladder, the largest measuring 2 cm in maximum diameter. The gallbladder wall is thickened and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid is also identified. The common bile duct is dilated measuring 1.1 cm in maximum diameter. The pancreatic head, neck, and body appear edematous. Mild-to-moderate amount of perihepatic ascites is also identified.",
