        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by symptoms including right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, fever, and the presence of a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with hyperemia noted on the CT scan, indicating inflammation. Additional findings such as the possibility of appendicolith and fat stranding around the appendix further corroborated the diagnosis."
