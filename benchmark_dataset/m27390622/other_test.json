There is surrounding stranding of the fat in the right lower quadrant. Visualized lung bases demonstrate mild atelectasis. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without any hydronephrosis. A 1.4 x 1.3 cm slightly hyperdense lesion within the interpolar region of the left kidney is likely also a hyperdense cyst.",
