The biliary tree is normal in caliber, and there is no evidence of choledocholithiasis. The spleen is markedly enlarged measuring 20 cm in craniocaudal length. There are two small non-enhancing cystic lesions of the pancreatic body which measure up to 6 mm. The hepatic parenchyma shows fatty infiltration. A non-enhancing 11 mm area in the right kidney likely represents a non-obstructing calculus. No hydronephrosis of either kidney.",
