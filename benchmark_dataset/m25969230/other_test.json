The distal common bile duct was cannulated and the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary tree was opacified, normal in morphology, contour, and caliber, without evidence of filling defects. The remnant cystic duct is visualized without evidence of leak. A stone fragment was seen in the duodenum near the ampulla.",
