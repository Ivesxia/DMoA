        "final_diagnosis": "Pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, along with a known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A CT scan suggested suspected AAA dissection, prompting transfer. Although AAA is a concern, the acute symptoms and resolution of pain with morphine suggest pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis."
