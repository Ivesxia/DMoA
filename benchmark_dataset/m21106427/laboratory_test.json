The visualized lung bases are clear, no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands and bladder appear unremarkable. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi. No free air or free fluid within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathology.",
