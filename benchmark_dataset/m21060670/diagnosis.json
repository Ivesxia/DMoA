        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset epigastric pain that migrated to the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea, suggesting gallbladder issues. Ultrasound findings revealed a mildly distended gallbladder with echogenic material consistent with cholelithiasis. However, there was no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening, edema, or pericholecystic fluid, aligning with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
