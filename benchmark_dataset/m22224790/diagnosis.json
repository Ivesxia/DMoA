        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with epigastric tightness, pressure, and nausea consistent with pancreatitis, along with a previous similar episode. Ultrasound findings revealed minimal gallstones in the gallbladder and the pancreas appeared within normal limits, but clinical symptoms and patient history led to the presumption of pancreatitis."
