            "findings": "The liver is slightly nodular in contour, consistent with known history of cirrhosis. There is mild drop in hepatic signal in the out-of-phase images compared to the in-phase images, consistent with steatosis. Few small T2 hyperintense non-enhancing cystic lesions in the liver, largest measuring 10 mm in segment VIII (15:9) are consistent with biliary hamartomas. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The CBD is normal in caliber. The gallbladder is distended with multiple gallstones, without evidence for acute cholecystitis. The adrenal glands and spleen are normal. The kidneys are unremarkable, except for a subcentimeter right renal cortical cyst. The pancreas is mildly atrophic, but demonstrates normal signal intensity and enhancement. There is no pancreatic mass or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Extensive anasarca is seen in the abdominal soft tissues, with fluid in the anterior pararenal space surrounding the pancreas as well as the right paracolic gutter. The imaged bowel loops are unremarkable. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are seen, with compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. The celiac trunk, SMA, and renal arteries are patent. There is an accessory replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery. The portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins are patent. The hepatic veins and IVC are normal. Paraesophageal portosystemic collaterals are seen. No marrow signal abnormality is seen.",
