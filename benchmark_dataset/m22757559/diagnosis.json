        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of presenting illness indicated RLQ pain that developed over three days, initially periumbilical but later localized to the RLQ. The complaint of moderate, constant, crampy pain without accompanying fever or gastrointestinal symptoms, combined with the CT findings of a hyperemic, dilated appendix with adjacent stranding, led to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
