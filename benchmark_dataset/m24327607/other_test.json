There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation. Dilation of the common duct to 9 mm is unchanged from ultrasound. A 1.2 cm stone within the gallbladder neck does not move with patient repositioning. The gallbladder is more distended than on previous ultrasound with trace pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic Murphy sign is equivocal with mild tenderness, but the patient received pain medications prior to the study. The pancreatic duct is normal measuring 3 mm, unchanged.",
