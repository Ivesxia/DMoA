        "final_diagnosis": "acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that evolved from periumbilical cramping to right lower quadrant pain, along with significant tenderness in the right lower quadrant on examination. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a fluid-filled and mildly enlarged distal appendix, consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of wall thickening or complications, further supporting the diagnosis."
