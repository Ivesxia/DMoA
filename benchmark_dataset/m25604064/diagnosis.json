        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, bilious vomiting, and epigastric/RUQ discomfort, alongside findings from the ERCP which showed opacification of the common bile duct with non-obstructing filling defects likely corresponding to gallstones. The lack of dilation of the common bile duct and normal pancreatic duct contour further supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis."
