Thickening of the bladder wall is unchanged. Doppler examination shows normal arterial and venous waveforms in the main renal artery and vein. Resistive indices within the upper, mid and lower poles are 0.78, 0.83 and 0.79 respectively, which are elevated and increased compared to the prior exam.",
