The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Aside from multifocal thin linear opacities suggesting minor multifocal atelectasis, most extensive in the medial right lower lobe, the lungs appear clear. There is a small pleural effusion on the left. A partly visualized drain is seen in the right upper quadrant. There is no pneumothorax.",
