            "findings": "The imaged lung bases demonstrate an unchanged 4-mm left lower lobe nodule. Mild central biliary ductal dilatation noted. The gallbladder is distended with slight pericholecystic fluid, without wall thickening or stranding to suggest cholecystitis. The pancreas is somewhat atrophic with minimal peripancreatic stranding. No free air or free fluid in the abdomen. There are marked degenerative changes at the L2-3 level with retrolisthesis of L2 on L3, total loss of the disc space, and irregularity of the L2 inferior and L3 superior endplates, compatible with recent history of osteomyelitis and discitis.",
            "changes_over_time": "Unchanged 4-mm left lower lobe nodule; marked degenerative changes at L2-3, compatible with recent history of osteomyelitis and discitis."
