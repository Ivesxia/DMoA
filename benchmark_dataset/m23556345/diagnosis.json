        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's acute onset abdominal pain, which began as generalized and moved to the right lower quadrant, along with nausea, vomiting, and chills, is consistent with acute appendicitis. The CT findings confirmed a dilated appendix, measuring 8 mm, with surrounding fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis. Additional findings such as no obstruction and the normal condition of other abdominal organs further supported this conclusion."
