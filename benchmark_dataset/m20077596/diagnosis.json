        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, which began after eating. Imaging studies via CT showed extensive inflammatory changes in the pancreas consistent with known gallstone pancreatitis, along with a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in place and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. No biliary duct dilation or abscess formation was present, further supporting this diagnosis."
