        "differential_diagnosis": "right diaphragm paralysis; right lower lobe of the lung collapse; acute on chronic gait dysfunction",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with signs of acute cholecystitis, which was confirmed through clinical evaluation and ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy. The patient's history of previous AVM and ongoing neurological deficits contributed to the complexity of his presentation, alongside episodes of fecal incontinence. Imaging studies showed changes consistent with the complications of cholecystitis and other concurrent issues, which were considered in the final diagnosis."
