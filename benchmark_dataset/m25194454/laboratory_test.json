The liver is otherwise homogeneous in signal intensity without suspicious mass. Moderate signal drop on out of phase imaging is consistent with hepatic steatosis (fat fraction 17%). No ascites noted. The gallbladder is notable for cholelithiasis and sludge, mildly dilated with heterogeneous enhancement and mild pericholecystic free fluid with gallbladder wall edema.",
