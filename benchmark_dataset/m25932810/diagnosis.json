        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was supported by the patient's acute-onset right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the CT findings showing a distended gallbladder containing gallstones without wall thickening. This presentation aligns well with acute cholecystitis."
