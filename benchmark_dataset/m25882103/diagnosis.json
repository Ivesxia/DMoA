        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 2 weeks of diffuse abdominal discomfort, migrating pain to the right lower quadrant over the past 5 days, exacerbated by oral intake, and episodes of non-bilious emesis. The CT scan showed a mildly dilated appendix measuring up to 7-8 mm in diameter with signs inconsistent with other pathologies (no free air or pelvic free fluid), supporting the diagnosis of appendicitis."
