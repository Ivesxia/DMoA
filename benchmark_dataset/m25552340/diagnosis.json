        "final_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain migrating from the periumbilicus to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of appendicitis. CT imaging revealed a dilated appendix measuring 1.6 cm containing multiple appendicoliths and focal hypoenhancement of its wall, raising concern for perforation. Additionally, there was surrounding free fluid in the pelvis. No other intra-abdominal abnormalities were noted, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
