        "final_diagnosis": "Acute diverticulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Renal colic",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right flank pain radiating to the groin, associated with suprapubic pain, nausea, and vomiting. CT imaging revealed evidence of diverticulosis and a focal area of thickened sigmoid wall compatible with acute diverticulitis, as well as a 3 mm stone in the distal ureter indicating renal colic. The clinical presentation and imaging findings led to the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis as the primary concern."
