The gallbladder is filled with multiple stones and sludge, without wall thickening or hyper enhancement to suggest acute cholecystitis. There is intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The CBD is mildly dilated to 8 mm. The distal CBD is irregular with enhancing wall. The pancreas is edematous with mild peripancreatic edema, consistent with mild interstitial edema. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated. Nonenhancing 7 mm lesion in the uncinate process could represent pocket of fluid or a side branch IPMN. Cortical renal cysts are seen bilaterally. A small amount of free perihepatic fluid is noted. No concerning retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.",
