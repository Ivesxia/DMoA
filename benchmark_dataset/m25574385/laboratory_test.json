Two are seen in the right liver, one measuring 1.3 cm and the other measuring 1 cm. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm. The gallbladder is distended with multiple small gallstones. They are not clearly impacted in the gallbladder neck, but do not significantly move with decubitus positioning. There is no mural edema or pericholecystic fluid seen. Sonographic ___ sign is not present as the patient is diffusely tender throughout the abdomen. The pancreas is not well seen due to overlying bowel gas.",
