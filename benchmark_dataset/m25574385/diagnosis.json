    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain that worsened over time. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a distended gallbladder with multiple small gallstones and diffuse tenderness throughout the abdomen, which is consistent with acute cholecystitis. The absence of significant gallbladder neck obstruction and mural edema on ultrasound also supports this diagnosis."
