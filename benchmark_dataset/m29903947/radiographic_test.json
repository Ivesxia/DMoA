The dominant hypoechoic focus measures 2.8 x 1.6 x 2.3 cm, previously measured 3.1 x 1.7 x 2.9 cm, unchanged to slightly decreased in size. The cluster of peripheral hypodense lesions in segment ___ measure up to 1.4 cm, unchanged since the prior study. A stable 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm echogenic focus in the right lobe of the liver may represent a hemangioma. There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilation up to 0.6 cm. The common bile duct is dilated up to 1.8 cm. The gallbladder wall is thickened measuring up to 0.5 cm with irregular internal echoes likely representing sludge. Pericholecystic fluid has decreased. There is stable pancreatic duct dilation up to 0.7 cm.",
