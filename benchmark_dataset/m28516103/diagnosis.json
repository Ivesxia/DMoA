        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain that began as epigastric pain and localized to the RLQ. Imaging findings from the CT abdomen and pelvis indicated a dilated appendix measuring up to 13 mm with mucosal hyper enhancement and periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with appendicitis, with no evidence of perforation or other complications."
