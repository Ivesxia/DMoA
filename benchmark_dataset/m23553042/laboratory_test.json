Mildly heterogeneous enhancement is seen in the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe, which may be associated with fatty infiltration. Otherwise, the liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. All other examined organs appear unremarkable or within normal limits.",
