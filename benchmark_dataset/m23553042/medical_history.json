She then developed intermittent sharp periumbilical abdominal pain yesterday, which became more severe overnight. She was able to tolerate a light dinner, but then had one episode of non-bilious non-bloody emesis at home and several more in the emergency department. Symptoms have been associated with chills at home, and an antispasmodic medication she tried was ineffective.",
