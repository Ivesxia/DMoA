        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and the CT findings showing a fluid-containing, mildly dilated appendix with appendicoliths. Additionally, the patient's history of long-standing constipation and previous episodes of similar symptoms contributed to the assessment, but ultimately the objective imaging findings corroborated the diagnosis."
