        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, associated with subjective fevers, nausea, anorexia, and non-bilious vomiting. The clinical findings of rebound tenderness and guarding on examination, along with the acute presentation, support the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. Acute blood loss anemia is indicated based on the presentation and possibly confirmed by laboratory findings."
