        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a history of minimal bowel movements, along with a physical examination showing a severely distended abdomen and tenderness. Imaging supported the finding of bowel distension consistent with bowel obstruction, and the patient's symptoms and history pointed towards appendicitis and internal hernia as the causes."
