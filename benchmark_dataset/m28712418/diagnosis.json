        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was supported by the symptoms of midepigastric pain radiating to the right lower quadrant, nausea, and vomiting over a period of three days. Imaging via ultrasound revealed a blind-ending tubular structure in the right lower quadrant with hyperemic walls and an appendicolith. There was also evidence of inflammatory change in the adjacent fat."
