        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis, including elevated amylase and lipase levels, along with the presence of a gallstone in the gallbladder, as shown by CT imaging. Cardiac evaluations were normal, ruling out cardiac causes for her initial symptoms, which further supported the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis."
