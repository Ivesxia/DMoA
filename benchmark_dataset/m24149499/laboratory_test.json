Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows patency and normal hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The common duct is not dilated measuring 7 mm. Numerous shadowing mobile gallstones are seen within the gallbladder, without pericholecystic fluid, wall edema or gallbladder wall dilation to suggest acute cholecystitis.
