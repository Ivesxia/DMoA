        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast) that showed a fluid-filled appendix measuring 0.8 cm, focal hyperemia at the appendiceal base, wall thickening, and mild mesenteric stranding. Additionally, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with appendicitis, including epigastric pain that radiated, and the lack of significant findings for other potential causes."
