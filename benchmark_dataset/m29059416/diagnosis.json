        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right flank pain of 1 month duration, which was described as constant and burning, accompanied by nausea and diminished appetite, leading to weight loss. Physical examination revealed right-sided flank tenderness. An abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas, but the clinical picture suggested pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis due to the symptomatology."
