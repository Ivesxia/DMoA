        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with lower abdominal pain and urinary symptoms; imaging (CT pelvis) showed thickening of the sigmoid colon with surrounding inflammatory changes and a phlegmonous fluid collection, consistent with diverticulitis. The decrease in the size of the collection suggested improvement without the need for intervention."
