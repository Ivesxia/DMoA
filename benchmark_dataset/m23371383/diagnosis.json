        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, a white blood cell count of 13, and a CT scan showing a dilated and hyperemic appendix without definitive surrounding inflammation. The physical examination also indicated tenderness to palpation in the RLQ."
