        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) accompanied by fever, chills, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed tenderness and rebound guarding in the RLQ, which are indicative of an acute abdominal condition. Imaging studies showed signs compatible with ileus. The clinical presentation and examination findings support the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis."
