        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by CT findings, which showed moderate thickening of the distal descending colon wall with adjacent pericolonic fat stranding and diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon. There was concern for colitis due to the wall thickening, and possibility of microperforation was raised due to the presence of extraluminal gas. However, no free air was seen adjacent to the descending colon."
