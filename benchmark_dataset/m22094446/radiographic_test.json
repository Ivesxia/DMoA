The cardiac silhouette is partially visualized; however, visualized portions of cardiomediastinal appear normal. 2 small opacities are seen on the lateral view in the anterior mediastinum unchanged from prior exam. Atelectatic changes adjacent to the right diaphragm are decreased. Consolidation in the left lung base most likely atelectatic change, however developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. Diaphragms are symmetric and non-elevated.",
