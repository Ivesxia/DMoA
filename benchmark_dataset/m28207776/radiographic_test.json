Patent portal veins. No hydronephrosis. No suspicious renal lesions. Contrast within stomach. Decompressed colon. Long segment of dilated small bowel, maximum 4.7 cm, upstream of a gradual transition point in the right lower quadrant to more decompressed ileal loops. Interval enlargement of the thin peripherally enhancing collection within the rectovesical space, 6.3 x 5.2 cm. An additional collection within the right pelvis, 2.9 x 6.6 cm. Generalized mesenteric stranding and a small amount of edema may be due to recent operation, or reactive. No pneumatosis or definite small bowel mural thickening to suggest ischemia. Normal caliber abdominal aorta. Layering contrast within bladder. No significant pelvic nodal enlargement. No suspicious osseous lesions. Sclerotic focus within the left sacral ala, presumed bone island. Small vertebral body Schmorl's nodes are noted, most prominently superior endplate L5.",
