        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Acute Pancreatitis was supported by the patient's presentation of severe mid-epigastric abdominal pain, elevated lipase levels (1576), and symptom relief following administration of morphine. Other lab values and ultrasound findings ruled out gallbladder disease and other abdominal pathologies."
