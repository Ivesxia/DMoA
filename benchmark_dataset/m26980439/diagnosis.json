        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, chronic abdominal symptoms, and significant weight loss. The ultrasound findings showed numerous gallstones and a mildly dilated gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis, which, combined with the patient's history of alcohol abuse and symptoms, led to the diagnosis of pancreatitis."
