The common duct size measures maximum dimension of 6 mm, which is upper limits of normal as before. The gallbladder is mildly dilated, which is nonspecific and can be compatible with a fasting state. Numerous shadowing gallstones are again demonstrated within the gallbladder lumen. No gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid is identified. Real-time scanning by the radiology resident demonstrates diffuse mid and right upper quadrant abdominal pain.",
