        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening R-sided abdominal pain and nausea, with a history of intermittent pain over the last two months. On examination, there was tenderness in the right hem abdomen, but no signs of peritonitis. The absence of fever, chills, and gastrointestinal symptoms suggested acute cholecystitis as the primary diagnosis."
