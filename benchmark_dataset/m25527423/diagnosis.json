        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of right upper quadrant pain, physical exam findings of tenderness in the RUQ, and imaging studies showing a distended gallbladder filled with large gallstones. Despite the absence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, the positive sonographic findings support the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
