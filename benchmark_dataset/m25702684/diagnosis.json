        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with 72 hours of epigastric pain that later migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by anorexia and nausea. The physical examination revealed tenderness in the RLQ and positive signs (McBurney's point tenderness and Rovsing's sign) indicative of appendicitis. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a mildly dilated appendix with adjacent periappendiceal fat stranding, supporting the diagnosis of acute appendicitis."
