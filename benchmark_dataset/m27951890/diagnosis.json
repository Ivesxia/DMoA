        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with imaging findings that showed a fluid-filled appendix measuring 11 mm, and minimal surrounding stranding. This was corroborated by the absence of other significant abnormalities in the abdominal and pelvic region on CT."
