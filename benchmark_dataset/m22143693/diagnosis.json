        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by CT imaging which revealed a 10.6-mm retrocecal, fluid-filled, blind-ending tubular structure with hyperenhancing walls, suggesting inflammation. Additionally, physical examination findings indicated tenderness in the infraumbilical midline area with rebound tenderness, further corroborating the diagnosis."
