A single new high-signal intensity lesion in the segment III of the liver measuring 8 mm consistent with either cyst or hemangioma. CBD is dilated up to 1 cm with mild left intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Gallbladder contains multiple small stones. No evidence of gallbladder distention or gallbladder wall thickening. The pancreas demonstrates normal signal intensity throughout without evidence of focal lesions. The spleen is of normal signal intensity throughout. Left kidney is within normal limits. Right kidney demonstrates moderate hydronephrosis with proximal hydroureter. Findings are most probably due to hydronephrosis of pregnancy.",
