    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Gallstone pancreatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe upper abdominal and back pain, which was persistent and sharp. Imaging via MRI revealed the presence of multiple small gallstones, alongside dilated CBD and mild biliary dilatation, suggesting a blockage likely due to the stones, consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. The absence of other significant findings in the pancreas further supports the diagnosis."
