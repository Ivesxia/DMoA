Discontinuity of the gallbladder wall laterally with an adjacent pericholecystic collection is seen along the inferior margin of the liver, compatible with perforation and a contained collection. Several gallstones are seen within the gallbladder, including one within the gallbladder neck. Mild periportal edema. A subcentimeter hepatic hypodensity within segment VII is too small to characterize, likely a cyst. Mild left basilar atelectasis. Trace right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.",
