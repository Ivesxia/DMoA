        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis was supported by the presence of an inflamed cecal diverticulum with surrounding pericolonic fat stranding and thickening of the lateroconal fascia noted on the CT scan. Additionally, there was mild thickening of the appendix's walls with minimal adjacent stranding, which was interpreted as secondary inflammation related to the diverticulitis."
