        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis was supported by CT findings showing marked eccentric wall thickening of the mid portion of the sigmoid colon with inflammatory changes in the adjacent mesenteric fat, consistent with diverticulitis. Although mild diverticulosis was noted, there were no signs of microperforation or extraluminal abscess, which further supported this diagnosis."
