        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe acute epigastric and RUQ pain, nausea, and fever, which led to imaging that showed layering of stones and sludge, contributing to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The patient's respiratory distress and chest imaging findings suggest pneumonia, along with the noted oxygen dependence."
