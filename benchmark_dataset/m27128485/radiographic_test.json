In the abdomen, there is a region of peripheral hyperenhancement in hepatic segment 6 measuring 3.2 x 2.1 cm, likely a transient hepatic attenuation difference. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated, measuring up to 9 mm in diameter with wall hyperenhancement. No evidence of perforation or abscess. Multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest measuring 1.3 cm, may represent cysts. No hydronephrosis.",
