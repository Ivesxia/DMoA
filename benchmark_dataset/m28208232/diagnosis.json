        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patient presented with a 12-hour history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, indicating a likely acute abdominal condition. She had a history of gastric ulcer and reported frequent GERD symptoms, but no prior similar symptoms. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastrium with no rebound or guarding, which supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis."
