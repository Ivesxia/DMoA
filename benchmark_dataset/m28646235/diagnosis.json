        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, abdominal pain, and elevated lactate, alongside imaging findings that indicated diverticula in the colon. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and tightness in the abdomen contributed to the diagnosis of diverticulitis, while the breast cancer was noted as a secondary diagnosis due to the patient's oncological history."
